Topic Arrangements of the Next Generation Science Standards 

 
At the beginning of the NGSS development process, in order to eliminate potential redundancy, seek an 
appropriate grain size, and seek natural connections among the Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs) identified 
within the Framework for K-12 Science Education, the writers arranged the DCIs into topics around which 
to develop the standards. This structure provided the original basis of the standards, and is preferred by 
many states.  However, the coding structure of individual performance expectations reflects 
the DCI arrangement in the Framework.  
  
Due to the fact that the NGSS progress toward end-of-high school core ideas, the standards may be 
rearranged in any order within a grade level.

Elementary Standards 

 
Students in kindergarten through fifth grade begin to develop an understanding of the four 
disciplinary core ideas: physical sciences; life sciences; earth and space sciences; and 
engineering, technology, and applications of science. In the earlier grades, students begin by 
recognizing patterns and formulating answers to questions about the world around them. By 
the end of fifth grade, students are able to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency in 
gathering, describing, and using information about the natural and designed world(s). The 
performance expectations in elementary school grade bands develop ideas and skills that will 
allow students to explain more complex phenomena in the four disciplines as they progress to 
middle school and high school. While the performance expectations shown in kindergarten 
through fifth grade couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional 
decisions should include use of many practices that lead to the performance expectations.

Kindergarten 

 

The performance expectations in kindergarten help students formulate answers to questions 
such as: “What happens if you push or pull an object harder? Where do animals live and why 
do they live there? What is the weather like today and how is it different from yesterday?” 
Kindergarten performance expectations include PS2, PS3, LS1, ESS2, ESS3, and ETS1 
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are expected to develop 
understanding of patterns and variations in local weather and the purpose of weather 
forecasting to prepare for, and respond to, severe weather. Students are able to apply an 
understanding of the effects of different strengths or different directions of pushes and pulls on 
the motion of an object to analyze a design solution. Students are also expected to develop 
understanding of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive and the 
relationship between their needs and where they live. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; 
cause and effect; systems and system models; interdependence of science, engineering, and 
technology; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural 
world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the kindergarten 
performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency 
in asking questions, developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, 
analyzing and interpreting data, designing solutions, engaging in argument from evidence, and 
obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students are expected to use these 
practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

Students who demonstrate understanding can: 

K.Forces and Interactions:  Pushes and Pulls 

K-PS2-1.  Plan and conduct an investigation to compare the effects of different strengths or different directions of pushes 

and pulls on the motion of an object.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of pushes or pulls could include a string attached to an object being pulled, 
a person pushing an object, a person stopping a rolling ball, and two objects colliding and pushing on each other.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to 
different relative strengths or different directions, but not both at the same time. Assessment does not include non-contact pushes or pulls such as those produced by 
magnets.] 

K-PS2-2.  Analyze data to determine if a design solution works as intended to change the speed or direction of an object 

with a push or a pull.*  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of problems requiring a solution could include having a marble or other object move a certain 
distance, follow a particular path, and knock down other objects. Examples of solutions could include tools such as a ramp to increase the speed of the object and a 
structure that would cause an object such as a marble or ball to turn.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include friction as a mechanism for change in 
speed.] 
The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education:

First Grade 

 

The performance expectations in first grade help students formulate answers to questions such 
as: “What happens when materials vibrate? What happens when there is no light? What are 
some ways plants and animals meet their needs so that they can survive and grow? How are 
parents and their children similar and different? What objects are in the sky and how do they 
seem to move?” First grade performance expectations include PS4, LS1, LS3, and ESS1 
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are expected to develop 
understanding of the relationship between sound and vibrating materials as well as between the 
availability of light and ability to see objects. The idea that light travels from place to place can 
be understood by students at this level through determining the effect of placing objects made 
with different materials in the path of a beam of light. Students are also expected to develop 
understanding of how plants and animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, 
and meet their needs as well as how behaviors of parents and offspring help the offspring 
survive. The understanding is developed that young plants and animals are like, but not exactly 
the same as, their parents. Students are able to observe, describe, and predict some patterns of 
the movement of objects in the sky. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; 
structure and function; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and 
the natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the 
first grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate 
proficiency in planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, 
constructing explanations and designing solutions, and obtaining, evaluating, and 
communicating information. Students are expected to use these practices to demonstrate

them, where the light cannot reach. Mirrors can be used 
to redirect a light beam. (Boundary: The idea that light 
travels from place to place is developed through 
experiences with light sources, mirrors, and shadows, but 
no attempt is made to discuss the speed of light.) (1-

Second Grade 

 

The performance expectations in second grade help students formulate answers to questions 
such as: “How does land change and what are some things that cause it to change? What are 
the different kinds of land and bodies of water? How are materials similar and different from 
one another, and how do the properties of the materials relate to their use? What do plants 
need to grow? How many types of living things live in a place?” Second grade performance 
expectations include PS1, LS2, LS4, ESS1, ESS2, and ETS1 Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC 
Framework. Students are expected to develop an understanding of what plants need to grow 
and how plants depend on animals for seed dispersal and pollination. Students are also 
expected to compare the diversity of life in different habitats. An understanding of observable 
properties of materials is developed by students at this level through analysis and classification 
of different materials. Students are able to apply their understanding of the idea that wind and 
water can change the shape of the land to compare design solutions to slow or prevent such 
change.  Students are able to use information and models to identify and represent the shapes 
and kinds of land and bodies of water in an area and where water is found on Earth. The 
crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; energy and matter; structure and function; 
stability and change; and influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the 
natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the 
second grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-
appropriate proficiency in developing and using models, planning and carrying out 
investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, constructing explanations and designing 
solutions, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating 
information. Students are expected to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the 
core ideas.

Third Grade 

 

The performance expectations in third grade help students formulate answers to questions such 
as: “What is typical weather in different parts of the world and during different times of the 
year? How can the impact of weather-related hazards be reduced? How do organisms vary in 
their traits? How are plants, animals, and environments of the past similar or different from 
current plants, animals, and environments? What happens to organisms when their 
environment changes? How do equal and unequal forces on an object affect the object? How 
can magnets be used?” Third grade performance expectations include PS2, LS1, LS2, LS3, LS4, 
ESS2, and ESS3 Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are able to organize 
and use data to describe typical weather conditions expected during a particular season. By 
applying their understanding of weather-related hazards, students are able to make a claim 
about the merit of a design solution that reduces the impacts of such hazards. Students are 
expected to develop an understanding of the similarities and differences of organisms’ life 
cycles. An understanding that organisms have different inherited traits, and that the 
environment can also affect the traits that an organism develops, is acquired by students at this 
level. In addition, students are able to construct an explanation using evidence for how the 
variations in characteristics among individuals of the same species may provide advantages in 
surviving, finding mates, and reproducing. Students are expected to develop an understanding 
of types of organisms that lived long ago and also about the nature of their environments. Third 
graders are expected to develop an understanding of the idea that when the environment 
changes some organisms survive and reproduce, some move to new locations, some move into 
the transformed environment, and some die. Students are able to determine the effects of 
balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object and the cause and effect 
relationships of electric or magnetic interactions between two objects not in contact with each 
other. They are then able to apply their understanding of magnetic interactions to define a 
simple design problem that can be solved with magnets. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; 
cause and effect; scale, proportion, and quantity; systems and system models; interdependence 
of science, engineering, and technology; and influence of engineering, technology, and science 
on society and the natural world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core 
ideas. In the third grade performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate 
grade-appropriate proficiency in asking questions and defining problems; developing and using 
models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, constructing 
explanations and designing solutions, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, 
evaluating, and communicating information. Students are expected to use these practices to 
demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

Students who demonstrate understanding can: 

3.Forces and Interactions 

3-PS2-1.  Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the 
motion of an object.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples could include an unbalanced force on one side of a ball can make it start moving; and, balanced 
forces pushing on a box from both sides will not produce any motion at all.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to one variable at a time: number, size, 
or direction of forces. Assessment does not include quantitative force size, only qualitative and relative. Assessment is limited to gravity being addressed as a force 
that pulls objects down.] 

3-PS2-2.  Make observations and/or measurements of an object’s motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to 

predict future motion.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of motion with a predictable pattern could include a child swinging in a swing, a ball rolling 
back and forth in a bowl, and two children on a see-saw.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include technical terms such as period and frequency.] 

3-PS2-3.  Ask questions to determine cause and effect relationships of electric or magnetic interactions between two 

objects not in contact with each other.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of an electric force could include the force on hair from an electrically 
charged balloon and the electrical forces between a charged rod and pieces of paper; examples of a magnetic force could include the force between two permanent 
magnets, the force between an electromagnet and steel paperclips, and the force exerted by one magnet versus the force exerted by two magnets. Examples of 
cause and effect relationships could include how the distance between objects affects strength of the force and how the orientation of magnets affects the direction 
of the magnetic force.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to forces produced by objects that can be manipulated by students, and electrical interactions 
are limited to static electricity.] 

3-PS2-4.  Define a simple design problem that can be solved by applying scientific ideas about magnets.*  [Clarification Statement:  

The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education: 

Examples of problems could include constructing a latch to keep a door shut and creating a device to keep two moving objects from touching each other.]

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Asking Questions and Defining Problems 
Asking questions and defining problems in grades 3–5 builds on 
grades K–2 experiences and progresses to specifying qualitative 
relationships. 
  Ask questions that can be investigated based on patterns 

such as cause and effect relationships. (3-PS2-3) 

  Define a simple problem that can be solved through the 

development of a new or improved object or tool. (3-PS2-4) 

Planning and Carrying Out Investigations 
Planning and carrying out investigations to answer questions or 
test solutions to problems in 3–5 builds on K–2 experiences and 
progresses to include investigations that control variables and 
provide evidence to support explanations or design solutions.  
  Plan and conduct an investigation collaboratively to produce 

data to serve as the basis for evidence, using fair tests in 
which variables are controlled and the number of trials 
considered. (3-PS2-1) 

  Make observations and/or measurements to produce data to 

serve as the basis for evidence for an explanation of a 
phenomenon or test a design solution. (3-PS2-2) 

 

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Connections to Nature of Science 

 
Science Knowledge is Based on Empirical Evidence 
  Science findings are based on recognizing patterns. (3-PS2-2) 
Scientific Investigations Use a Variety of Methods  
  Science investigations use a variety of methods, tools, and 

techniques. (3-PS2-1) 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

PS2.A:  Forces and Motion 
  Each force acts on one particular object and has both 
strength and a direction. An object at rest typically has 
multiple forces acting on it, but they add to give zero 
net force on the object. Forces that do not sum to zero 
can cause changes in the object’s speed or direction of 
motion. (Boundary: Qualitative and conceptual, but not 
quantitative addition of forces are used at this level.) 
(3-PS2-1) 

  The patterns of an object’s motion in various situations 
can be observed and measured; when that past motion 
exhibits a regular pattern, future motion can be 
predicted from it. (Boundary: Technical terms, such as 
magnitude, velocity, momentum, and vector quantity, 
are not introduced at this level, but the concept that 
some quantities need both size and direction to be 
described is developed.) (3-PS2-2)  

PS2.B:  Types of Interactions  
  Objects in contact exert forces on each other. (3-PS2-1) 
  Electric and magnetic forces between a pair of objects 
do not require that the objects be in contact. The sizes 
of the forces in each situation depend on the properties 
of the objects and their distances apart and, for forces 
between two magnets, on their orientation relative to 
each other. (3-PS2-3),(3-PS2-4) 

Patterns 
  Patterns of change can be used to make 

predictions. (3-PS2-2) 

Cause and Effect 
  Cause and effect relationships are routinely 

identified. (3-PS2-1) 

  Cause and effect relationships are routinely 

identified, tested, and used to explain 
change. (3-PS2-3) 

------------------------------------------------ 
Connections to Engineering, Technology,	

and Applications of Science	

 
Interdependence of Science, Engineering, 
and Technology 
  Scientific discoveries about the natural world 

can often lead to new and improved 
technologies, which are developed through 
the engineering design process. (3-PS2-4)

Fourth Grade 

 
The performance expectations in fourth grade help students formulate answers to questions 
such as: “What are waves and what are some things they can do? How can water, ice, wind 
and vegetation change the land? What patterns of Earth’s features can be determined with the 
use of maps? How do internal and external structures support the survival, growth, behavior, 
and reproduction of plants and animals? What is energy and how is it related to motion? How is 
energy transferred? How can energy be used to solve a problem?” Fourth grade performance 
expectations include PS3, PS4, LS1, ESS1, ESS2, ESS3, and ETS1 Disciplinary Core Ideas from 
the NRC Framework. Students are able to use a model of waves to describe patterns of waves 
in terms of amplitude and wavelength, and that waves can cause objects to move. Students are 
expected to develop understanding of the effects of weathering or the rate of erosion by water, 
ice, wind, or vegetation. They apply their knowledge of natural Earth processes to generate and 
compare multiple solutions to reduce the impacts of such processes on humans. In order to 
describe patterns of Earth’s features, students analyze and interpret data from maps. Fourth 
graders are expected to develop an understanding that plants and animals have internal and 
external structures that function to support survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction. By 
developing a model, they describe that an object can be seen when light reflected from its 
surface enters the eye. Students are able to use evidence to construct an explanation of the 
relationship between the speed of an object and the energy of that object. Students are 
expected to develop an understanding that energy can be transferred from place to place by 
sound, light, heat, and electric currents or from object to object through collisions. They apply 
their understanding of energy to design, test, and refine a device that converts energy from one 
form to another. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; energy and matter; 
systems and system models; interdependence of science, engineering, and technology; and 
influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are called 
out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the fourth grade performance 
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency in asking 
questions, developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing 
and interpreting data, constructing explanations and designing solutions, engaging in argument 
from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students are 
expected to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

quantitative measurements of energy.] 

4-PS3-4.  Apply scientific ideas to design, test, and refine a device that converts energy from one form to another.*  [Clarification 
Statement:  Examples of devices could include electric circuits that convert electrical energy into motion energy of a vehicle, light, or sound; and, a passive solar heater 
that converts light into heat. Examples of constraints could include the materials, cost, or time to design the device.] [Assessment Boundary:  Devices should be limited 
to those that convert motion energy to electric energy or use stored energy to cause motion or produce light or sound.] 

4-ESS3-1.  Obtain and combine information to describe that energy and fuels are derived from natural resources and their uses 
affect the environment.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of renewable energy resources could include wind energy, water behind dams, and sunlight; non-
renewable energy resources are fossil fuels and fissile materials. Examples of environmental effects could include loss of habitat due to dams, loss of habitat due to 
surface mining, and air pollution from burning of fossil fuels.]

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

Asking Questions and Defining Problems 
Asking questions and defining problems in grades 3–5 
builds on grades K–2 experiences and progresses to 
specifying qualitative relationships. 
  Ask questions that can be investigated and predict 

reasonable outcomes based on patterns such as cause 
and effect relationships. (4-PS3-3) 

Planning and Carrying Out Investigations  
Planning and carrying out investigations to answer 
questions or test solutions to problems in 3–5 builds on K–
2 experiences and progresses to include investigations that 
control variables and provide evidence to support 
explanations or design solutions. 
  Make observations to produce data to serve as the 

basis for evidence for an explanation of a 
phenomenon or test a design solution. (4-PS3-2) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 3–5 
builds on K–2 experiences and progresses to the use of 
evidence in constructing explanations that specify 
variables that describe and predict phenomena and in 
designing multiple solutions to design problems. 
  Use evidence (e.g., measurements, observations, 
patterns) to construct an explanation. (4-PS3-1) 

  Apply scientific ideas to solve design problems. (4-

PS3-4) 

Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating 
Information 
Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information in 
3–5 builds on K–2 experiences and progresses to evaluate 
the merit and accuracy of ideas and methods. 
  Obtain and combine information from books and other 

reliable media to explain phenomena. (4-ESS3-1) 

PS3.A:  Definitions of Energy  
  The faster a given object is moving, the more energy it possesses. (4-

Cause and Effect   
  Cause and effect relationships are 

PS3-1) 

  Energy can be moved from place to place by moving objects or 

through sound, light, or electric currents. (4-PS3-2),(4-PS3-3) 

PS3.B:  Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer 
  Energy is present whenever there are moving objects, sound, light, or 
heat. When objects collide, energy can be transferred from one object 
to another, thereby changing their motion. In such collisions, some 
energy is typically also transferred to the surrounding air; as a result, 
the air gets heated and sound is produced. (4-PS3-2),(4-PS3-3) 

  Light also transfers energy from place to place. (4-PS3-2) 
  Energy can also be transferred from place to place by electric currents, 

which can then be used locally to produce motion, sound, heat, or 
light. The currents may have been produced to begin with by 
transforming the energy of motion into electrical energy. (4-PS3-2),(4-
PS3-4) 

PS3.C:  Relationship Between Energy and Forces 
  When objects collide, the contact forces transfer energy so as to 

change the objects’ motions. (4-PS3-3) 

PS3.D:  Energy in Chemical Processes and Everyday Life 
  The expression “produce energy” typically refers to the conversion of 

stored energy into a desired form for practical use. (4-PS3-4) 

ESS3.A:  Natural Resources  
  Energy and fuels that humans use are derived from natural sources, 

and their use affects the environment in multiple ways. Some 
resources are renewable over time, and others are not. (4-ESS3-1)  

ETS1.A:  Defining Engineering Problems 
  Possible solutions to a problem are limited by available materials and 

resources (constraints). The success of a designed solution is 
determined by considering the desired features of a solution (criteria). 
Different proposals for solutions can be compared on the basis of how 
well each one meets the specified criteria for success or how well each 
takes the constraints into account. (secondary to 4-PS3-4) 

routinely identified and used to explain 
change. (4-ESS3-1)

Scientific Knowledge is Based on Empirical Evidence 
  Science findings are based on recognizing patterns. (4-

PS4-1) 

PS4.A:  Wave Properties  
  Waves, which are regular patterns of motion, can be made 

in water by disturbing the surface. When waves move 
across the surface of deep water, the water goes up and 
down in place; there is no net motion in the direction of 
the wave except when the water meets a beach. (Note: 
This grade band endpoint was moved from K–2). (4-PS4-1) 

  Waves of the same type can differ in amplitude (height of 
the wave) and wavelength (spacing between wave peaks). 
(4-PS4-1) 

PS4.C:  Information Technologies and Instrumentation 
  Digitized information can be transmitted over long 

distances without significant degradation. High-tech 
devices, such as computers or cell phones, can receive and 
decode information—convert it from digitized form to 
voice—and vice versa. (4-PS4-3) 

ETS1.C:  Optimizing The Design Solution 
  Different solutions need to be tested in order to determine 

which of them best solves the problem, given the criteria 
and the constraints. (secondary to 4-PS4-3) 

Patterns 
  Similarities and differences in patterns can be 
used to sort and classify natural phenomena.

Fifth Grade 

 
The performance expectations in fifth grade help students formulate answers to questions such 
as: “When matter changes, does its weight change? How much water can be found in different 
places on Earth? Can new substances be created by combining other substances? How does 
matter cycle through ecosystems? Where does the energy in food come from and what is it 
used for? How do lengths and directions of shadows or relative lengths of day and night change 
from day to day, and how does the appearance of some stars change in different seasons?” 
Fifth grade performance expectations include PS1, PS2, PS3, LS1, LS2, ESS1, ESS2, and ESS3 
Disciplinary Core Ideas from the NRC Framework. Students are able to describe that matter is 
made of particles too small to be seen through the development of a model. Students develop 
an understanding of the idea that regardless of the type of change that matter undergoes, the 
total weight of matter is conserved. Students determine whether the mixing of two or more 
substances results in new substances.  Through the development of a model using an example, 
students are able to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere 
interact.  They describe and graph data to provide evidence about the distribution of water on 
Earth. Students develop an understanding of the idea that plants get the materials they need 
for growth chiefly from air and water. Using models, students can describe the movement of 
matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment and that energy in animals’ 
food was once energy from the sun. Students are expected to develop an understanding of 
patterns of daily changes in length and direction of shadows, day and night, and the seasonal 
appearance of some stars in the night sky. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and 
effect; scale, proportion, and quantity; energy and matter; and systems and systems models 
are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the fifth grade 
performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency 
in developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and 
interpreting data, using mathematics and computational thinking, engaging in argument from 
evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information; and to use these practices 
to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

using models to represent events and design solutions. 
  Develop a model to describe phenomena. (5-PS1-1) 
Planning and Carrying Out Investigations 
Planning and carrying out investigations to answer 
questions or test solutions to problems in 3–5 builds on 
K–2 experiences and progresses to include investigations 
that control variables and provide evidence to support 
explanations or design solutions.  
  Conduct an investigation collaboratively to produce 

data to serve as the basis for evidence, using fair 
tests in which variables are controlled and the 
number of trials considered. (5-PS1-4) 

  Make observations and measurements to produce 

data to serve as the basis for evidence for an 
explanation of a phenomenon. (5-PS1-3) 

Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking 
Mathematical and computational thinking in 3–5 builds

PS1.A:  Structure and Properties of Matter 
  Matter of any type can be subdivided into particles that are too 

Cause and Effect 
  Cause and effect relationships are routinely 

small to see, but even then the matter still exists and can be 
detected by other means. A model showing that gases are made 
from matter particles that are too small to see and are moving 
freely around in space can explain many observations, including 
the inflation and shape of a balloon and the effects of air on 
larger particles or objects. (5-PS1-1) 

  The amount (weight) of matter is conserved when it changes 

form, even in transitions in which it seems to vanish. (5-PS1-2) 
  Measurements of a variety of properties can be used to identify 
materials. (Boundary: At this grade level, mass and weight are 
not distinguished, and no attempt is made to define the unseen 
particles or explain the atomic-scale mechanism of evaporation 
and condensation.) (5-PS1-3)

  When two or more different substances are mixed, a new 

substance with different properties may be formed. (5-PS1-4)

5.Matter and Energy in Organisms and Ecosystems 
Students who demonstrate understanding can: 
5-PS3-1.  Use models to describe that energy in animals’ food (used for body repair, growth, motion, and to maintain body 

warmth) was once energy from the sun.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of models could include diagrams, and flow charts.] 

5-LS1-1.  Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.  [Clarification 

Statement:  Emphasis is on the idea that plant matter comes mostly from air and water, not from the soil.] 

5-LS2-1.  Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.  
[Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the idea that matter that is not food (air, water, decomposed materials in soil) is changed by plants into matter that is food. 
Examples of systems could include organisms, ecosystems, and the Earth.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include molecular explanations.]

Developing and Using Models 
Modeling in 3–5 builds on K–2 experiences and 
progresses to building and revising simple models and 
using models to represent events and design solutions.  
  Use models to describe phenomena. (5-PS3-1) 
  Develop a model to describe phenomena. (5-LS2-1) 
Engaging in Argument from Evidence 
Engaging in argument from evidence in 3–5 builds on K–
2 experiences and progresses to critiquing the scientific 
explanations or solutions proposed by peers by citing 
relevant evidence about the natural and designed 
world(s). 
  Support an argument with evidence, data, or a 

model. (5-LS1-1)

Connections to Nature of Science 

 
Science Models, Laws, Mechanisms, and Theories 
Explain Natural Phenomena 
  Science explanations describe the mechanisms for 

natural events. (5-LS2-1) 

PS3.D:  Energy in Chemical Processes and Everyday Life 
  The energy released [from] food was once energy from the sun 
that was captured by plants in the chemical process that forms 
plant matter (from air and water). (5-PS3-1) 

LS1.C:  Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms 
  Food provides animals with the materials they need for body 
repair and growth and the energy they need to maintain body 
warmth and for motion. (secondary to 5-PS3-1) 

  Plants acquire their material for growth chiefly from air and water. 

Systems and System Models 
  A system can be described in terms of its 
components and their interactions. (5-LS2-
1) 

Energy and Matter 
  Matter is transported into, out of, and 

within systems. (5-LS1-1) 

  Energy can be transferred in various ways 

and between objects. (5-PS3-1) 

(5-LS1-1) 

LS2.A:  Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems 
  The food of almost any kind of animal can be traced back to 

plants. Organisms are related in food webs in which some animals 
eat plants for food and other animals eat the animals that eat 
plants. Some organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, break down 
dead organisms (both plants or plants parts and animals) and 
therefore operate as “decomposers.” Decomposition eventually 
restores (recycles) some materials back to the soil. Organisms can 
survive only in environments in which their particular needs are 
met. A healthy ecosystem is one in which multiple species of 
different types are each able to meet their needs in a relatively 
stable web of life. Newly introduced species can damage the 
balance of an ecosystem. (5-LS2-1) 

LS2.B:  Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems 
  Matter cycles between the air and soil and among plants, animals, 

and microbes as these organisms live and die. Organisms obtain 
gases, and water, from the environment, and release waste 
matter (gas, liquid, or solid) back into the environment. (5-LS2-1)

ESS2.A:  Earth Materials and Systems 
  Earth’s major systems are the geosphere (solid and molten 
rock, soil, and sediments), the hydrosphere (water and ice), 
the atmosphere (air), and the biosphere (living things, 
including humans). These systems interact in multiple ways 
to affect Earth’s surface materials and processes. The ocean 
supports a variety of ecosystems and organisms, shapes 
landforms, and influences climate. Winds and clouds in the 
atmosphere interact with the landforms to determine 
patterns of weather. (5-ESS2-1) 

ESS2.C:  The Roles of Water in Earth’s Surface Processes 
  Nearly all of Earth’s available water is in the ocean. Most 

fresh water is in glaciers or underground; only a tiny fraction 
is in streams, lakes, wetlands, and the atmosphere. (5-
ESS2-2) 

ESS3.C:  Human Impacts on Earth Systems 
  Human activities in agriculture, industry, and everyday life 
have had major effects on the land, vegetation, streams, 
ocean, air, and even outer space. But individuals and 
communities are doing things to help protect Earth’s 
resources and environments. (5-ESS3-1)

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Asking Questions and Defining Problems  
Asking questions and defining problems in 3–5 builds on 
grades K–2 experiences and progresses to specifying 
qualitative relationships. 
  Define a simple design problem that can be solved through 
the development of an object, tool, process, or system and 
includes several criteria for success and constraints on 
materials, time, or cost. (3-5-ETS1-1) 

Planning and Carrying Out Investigations  
Planning and carrying out investigations to answer questions 
or test solutions to problems in 3–5 builds on K–2 experiences 
and progresses to include investigations that control variables 
and provide evidence to support explanations or design 
solutions.  
  Plan and conduct an investigation collaboratively to 

produce data to serve as the basis for evidence, using fair 
tests in which variables are controlled and the number of 
trials considered. (3-5-ETS1-3)  

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions  
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 3–5 builds 
on K–2 experiences and progresses to the use of evidence in 
constructing explanations that specify variables that describe 
and predict phenomena and in designing multiple solutions to 
design problems. 
  Generate and compare multiple solutions to a problem 

based on how well they meet the criteria and constraints 
of the design problem. (3-5-ETS1-2)  

ETS1.A:  Defining and Delimiting Engineering Problems 
  Possible solutions to a problem are limited by available materials 
and resources (constraints). The success of a designed solution is 
determined by considering the desired features of a solution 
(criteria). Different proposals for solutions can be compared on the 
basis of how well each one meets the specified criteria for success 
or how well each takes the constraints into account. (3-5-ETS1-1) 

ETS1.B:  Developing Possible Solutions 
  Research on a problem should be carried out before beginning to 

design a solution.  Testing a solution involves investigating how 
well it performs under a range of likely conditions. (3-5-ETS1-2) 

  At whatever stage, communicating with peers about proposed 

solutions is an important part of the design process, and shared 
ideas can lead to improved designs. (3-5-ETS1-2) 

  Tests are often designed to identify failure points or difficulties, 

which suggest the elements of the design that need to be 
improved. (3-5-ETS1-3) 

ETS1.C:  Optimizing the Design Solution 
  Different solutions need to be tested in order to determine which of 

them best solves the problem, given the criteria and the 
constraints. (3-5-ETS1-3) 

Crosscutting Concepts 
Influence of Science, Engineering, 
and Technology on Society and the 
Natural World 
  People’s needs and wants change 
over time, as do their demands for 
new and improved technologies. (3-
5-ETS1-1) 

  Engineers improve existing 

technologies or develop new ones to 
increase their benefits, decrease 
known risks, and meet societal 
demands. (3-5-ETS1-2)

Middle School Physical Science 

 
Students in middle school continue to develop understanding of four core ideas in the physical 
sciences. The middle school performance expectations in the Physical Sciences build on the K – 5 
ideas and capabilities to allow learners to explain phenomena central to the physical sciences but 
also to the life sciences and earth and space science. The performance expectations in physical 
science blend the core ideas with scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts to 
support students in developing useable knowledge to explain real world phenomena in the 
physical, biological, and earth and space sciences. In the physical sciences, performance 
expectations at the middle school level focus on students developing understanding of several 
scientific practices. These include developing and using models, planning and conducting 
investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, using mathematical and computational thinking, 
and constructing explanations; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the 
core ideas. Students are also expected to demonstrate understanding of several of engineering 
practices including design and evaluation.   
 
The performance expectations in the topic Structure and Properties of Matter help students to 
formulate an answer to the questions: “How can particles combine to produce a substance with 
different properties? How does thermal energy affect particles?” by building understanding of what 
occurs at the atomic and molecular scale. By the end of middle school, students will be able to 
apply understanding that pure substances have characteristic properties and are made from a 
single type of atom or molecule. They will be able to provide molecular level accounts to explain 
states of matters and changes between states. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect; 
scale, proportion and quantity; structure and function; interdependence of science, engineering, 
and technology; and influence of science, engineering and technology on society and the natural 
world are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance 
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, 
and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information. Students use these scientific and 
engineering practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. 
 
The performance expectations in the topic Chemical Reactions help students to formulate an 
answer to the questions: “What happens when new materials are formed? What stays the same 
and what changes?” by building understanding of what occurs at the atomic and molecular scale 
during chemical reactions. By the end of middle school, students will be able to provide molecular 
level accounts to explain that chemical reactions involve regrouping of atoms to form new 
substances, and that atoms rearrange during chemical reactions. Students are also able to apply 
an understanding of the design and the process of optimization in engineering to chemical reaction 
systems. The crosscutting concepts of patterns and energy and matter are called out as organizing 
concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance expectations, students are 
expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, analyzing and interpreting 
data, and designing solutions. Students use these scientific and engineering practices to 
demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. 
 
The performance expectations in the topic Forces and Interactions focus on helping students 
understand ideas related to why some objects will keep moving, why objects fall to the ground and 
why some materials are attracted to each other while others are not. Students answer the 
question, “How can one describe physical interactions between objects and within systems of 
objects?” At the middle school level, the PS2 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework is 
broken down into two sub-ideas:  Forces and Motion and Types of interactions. By the end of 

November 2013©2013 Achieve, Inc. All rights reserved.33 of 102 

middle school, students will be able to apply Newton’s Third Law of Motion to relate forces to 
explain the motion of objects. Students also apply ideas about gravitational, electrical, and 
magnetic forces to explain a variety of phenomena including beginning ideas about why some 
materials attract each other while other repel. In particular, students will develop understanding 
that gravitational interactions are always attractive but that electrical and magnetic forces can be 
both attractive and negative. Students also develop ideas that objects can exert forces on each 
other even though the objects are not in contact, through fields. Students are also able to apply an 
engineering practice and concept to solve a problem caused when objects collide. The crosscutting 
concepts of cause and effect; system and system models; stability and change; and the influence 
of science, engineering, and technology on society and the natural world serve as organizing 
concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance expectations, students are 
expected to demonstrate proficiency in asking questions, planning and carrying out investigations, 
and designing solutions, and engaging in argument; and to use these practices to demonstrate 
understanding of the core ideas.  
 
The performance expectations in the topic Energy help students formulate an answer to the 
question, “How can energy be transferred from one object or system to another?” At the middle 
school level, the PS3 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework is broken down into four 
sub-core ideas:  Definitions of Energy, Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer, the 
Relationship between Energy and Forces, and Energy in Chemical Process and Everyday Life.  
Students develop their understanding of important qualitative ideas about energy including that 
the interactions of objects can be explained and predicted using the concept of transfer of energy 
from one object or system of objects to another, and that that the total change of energy in any 
system is always equal to the total energy transferred into or out of the system. Students 
understand that objects that are moving have kinetic energy and that objects may also contain 
stored (potential) energy, depending on their relative positions. Students will also come to know 
the difference between energy and temperature, and begin to develop an understanding of the 
relationship between force and energy. Students are also able to apply an understanding of design 
to the process of energy transfer. The crosscutting concepts of scale, proportion, and quantity; 
systems and system models; and energy are called out as organizing concepts for these 
disciplinary core ideas. These performance expectations expect students to demonstrate 
proficiency in developing and using models, planning investigations, analyzing and interpreting 
data, and designing solutions, and engaging in argument from evidence; and to use these 
practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas in PS3.  
 
The performance expectations in the topic Waves and Electromagnetic Radiation help 
students formulate an answer to the question, “What are the characteristic properties of waves 
and how can they be used?” At the middle school level, the PS4 Disciplinary Core Idea from the 
NRC Framework is broken down into Wave Properties, Electromagnetic Radiation, and Information 
Technologies and Instrumentation. Students are able to describe and predict characteristic 
properties and behaviors of waves when the waves interact with matter. Students can apply an 
understanding of waves as a means to send digital information. The crosscutting concepts of 
patterns and structure and function are used as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core 
ideas. These performance expectations focus on students demonstrating proficiency in developing 
and using models, using mathematical thinking, and obtaining, evaluating and communicating 
information; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

Middle School Life Science 

 
Students in middle school develop understanding of key concepts to help them make sense of 
life science. The ideas build upon students’ science understanding from earlier grades and from 
the disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts of 
other experiences with physical and earth sciences. There are four life science disciplinary core 
ideas in middle school: 1) From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes, 2) 
Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics, 3) Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of 
Traits, 4) Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity. The performance expectations in middle 
school blend the core ideas with scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts 
to support students in developing useable knowledge across the science disciplines. While the 
performance expectations in middle school life science couple particular practices with specific 
disciplinary core ideas, instructional decisions should include use of many science and 
engineering practices integrated in the performance expectations. 
 
The performance expectations in LS1: From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and 
Processes help students formulate an answer to the question, “How can one explain the ways 
cells contribute to the function of living organisms.” The LS1 Disciplinary Core Idea from the 
NRC Framework is organized into four sub-ideas:  Structure and Function, Growth and 
Development of Organisms, Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms, and 
Information Processing. Students can gather information and use this information to support 
explanations of the structure and function relationship of cells. They can communicate 
understanding of cell theory. They have a basic understanding of the role of cells in body 
systems and how those systems work to support the life functions of the organism. The 
understanding of cells provides a context for the plant process of photosynthesis and the 
movement of matter and energy needed for the cell. Students can construct an explanation for 
how environmental and genetic factors affect growth of organisms.  They can connect this to 
the role of animal behaviors in reproduction of animals as well as the dependence of some 
plants on animal behaviors for their reproduction. Crosscutting concepts of cause and effect, 
structure and function, and matter and energy are called out as organizing concepts for the 
core ideas about processes of living organisms.  
 
The performance expectations in LS2: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics Relationships 
in Ecosystems help students formulate an answer to the question, “How does a system of 
living and non-living things operate to meet the needs of the organisms in an ecosystem?” The 
LS2 Disciplinary Core Idea is divided into three sub-ideas:  Interdependent Relationships in 
Ecosystems; Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems; and Ecosystem Dynamics, 
Functioning, and Resilience. Students can analyze and interpret data, develop models, and 
construct arguments and demonstrate a deeper understanding of resources and the cycling of 
matter and the flow of energy in ecosystems. They can also study patterns of the interactions 
among organisms within an ecosystem. They consider biotic and abiotic factors in an ecosystem 
and the effects these factors have on population. They evaluate competing design solutions for 
maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services.   
 
The performance expectations in LS3: Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits help 
students formulate an answer to the question, “How do living organisms pass traits from one 
generation to the next?” The LS3 Disciplinary Core Idea from the NRC Framework includes two 
sub-ideas:  Inheritance of Traits, and Variation of Traits. Students can use models to describe 

November 2013©2013 Achieve, Inc. All rights reserved.35 of 102 

ways gene mutations and sexual reproduction contribute to genetic variation. Crosscutting 
concepts of cause and effect and structure and function provide students with a deeper 
understanding of how gene structure determines differences in the functioning of organisms. 
 
The performance expectations in LS4: Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity help 
students formulate an answer to the question, “How do organisms change over time in 
response to changes in the environment?” The LS4 Disciplinary Core Idea is divided into four 
sub-ideas:  Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity, Natural Selection, Adaptation, and 
Biodiversity and Humans. Students can construct explanations based on evidence to support 
fundamental understandings of natural selection and evolution. They can use ideas of genetic 
variation in a population to make sense of organisms surviving and reproducing, hence passing 
on the traits of the species. They are able to use fossil records and anatomical similarities of the 
relationships among organisms and species to support their understanding. Crosscutting 
concepts of patterns and structure and function contribute to the evidence students can use to 
describe biological evolution.

Middle School Earth and Space Sciences 

 

 
Students in middle school develop understanding of a wide range of topics in Earth and 
space science (ESS) that build upon science concepts from elementary school through 
more advanced content, practice, and crosscutting themes. There are six ESS standard 
topics in middle school: Space Systems, History of Earth, Earth’s Interior Systems, 
Earth’s Surface Systems, Weather and Climate, and Human Impacts. The content of the 
performance expectations are based on current community-based geoscience literacy 
efforts such as the Earth Science Literacy Principles (Wysession et al., 2012), and is 
presented with a greater emphasis on an Earth Systems Science approach. The 
performance expectations strongly reflect the many societally relevant aspects of ESS 
(resources, hazards, environmental impacts) as well as related connections to 
engineering and technology. While the performance expectations shown in middle 
school ESS couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional 
decisions should include use of many practices that lead to the performance 
expectations. 
 
The performance expectations in MS.Space Systems help students formulate answers 
to the questions: “What is Earth’s place in the Universe?” and “What makes up our solar 
system and how can the motion of Earth explain seasons and eclipses?” Two sub-ideas 
from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance expectations: ESS1.A and 
ESS1.B.  Middle school students can examine the Earth’s place in relation to the solar 
system, Milky Way galaxy, and universe. There is a strong emphasis on a systems 
approach, using models of the solar system to explain astronomical and other 
observations of the cyclic patterns of eclipses, tides, and seasons. There is also a strong 
connection to engineering through the instruments and technologies that have allowed 
us to explore the objects in our solar system and obtain the data that support the 
theories that explain the formation and evolution of the universe. The crosscutting 
concepts of patterns; scale, proportion, and quantity; systems and system models; and 
interdependence of science, engineering, and technology are called out as organizing 
concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.  In the MS.Space Systems performance 
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using 
models and analyzing and interpreting data; and to use these practices to demonstrate 
understanding of the core ideas. 
 
The performance expectations in MS.History of Earth help students formulate answers 
to the questions: “How do people figure out that the Earth and life on Earth have 
changed over time?” and “How does the movement of tectonic plates impact the surface 
of Earth?” Four sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance 
expectations: ESS1.C, ESS2.A, ESS2.B, and ESS2.C.  Students can examine geoscience 
data in order to understand the processes and events in Earth’s history. Important 
concepts in this topic are “Scale, Proportion, and Quantity” and “Stability and Change,” 
in relation to the different ways geologic processes operate over the long expanse of 
geologic time. An important aspect of the history of Earth is that geologic events and 
conditions have affected the evolution of life, but different life forms have also played 
important roles in altering Earth’s systems. In the MS.History of Earth performance 
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in analyzing and 

 

November 2013©2013 Achieve, Inc. All rights reserved.37 of 102 

interpreting data, and constructing explanations; and to use these practices to 
demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. 
 
The performance expectations in MS.Earth’s Systems help students formulate 
answers to the questions: “How do the materials in and on Earth’s crust change over 
time?” and “How does water influence weather, circulate in the oceans, and shape 
Earth’s surface?” Three sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these 
performance expectations: ESS2.A, ESS2.C, and ESS3.A.  Students understand how 
Earth’s geosystems operate by modeling the flow of energy and cycling of matter within 
and among different systems. Students can investigate the controlling properties of 
important materials and construct explanations based on the analysis of real geoscience 
data. Of special importance in both topics are the ways that geoscience processes 
provide resources needed by society but also cause natural hazards that present risks to 
society; both involve technological challenges, for the identification and development of 
resources and for the mitigation of hazards. The crosscutting concepts of cause and 
effect, energy and matter, and stability and change are called out as organizing 
concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.  In the MS.Earth’s Systems performance 
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using 
models and constructing explanations; and to use these practices to demonstrate 
understanding of the core ideas. 
 
The performance expectations in MS.Weather and Climate help students formulate 
an answer to the question: “What factors interact and influence weather and climate?” 
Three sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance 
expectations: ESS2.C, ESS2.D, and ESS3.D.  Students can construct and use models to 
develop understanding of the factors that control weather and climate. A systems 
approach is also important here, examining the feedbacks between systems as energy 
from the sun is transferred between systems and circulates though the ocean and 
atmosphere. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect, systems and system 
models, and stability and change are called out as organizing concepts for these 
disciplinary core ideas.  In the MS.Weather and Climate performance expectations, 
students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in asking questions, developing and 
using models, and planning and carrying out investigations; and to use these practices 
to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. 
 
The performance expectations in MS.Human Impacts help students formulate 
answers to the questions: “How can natural hazards be predicted?” and “How do human 
activities affect Earth systems?” Two sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed 
in these performance expectations: ESS3.B and ESS3.C.  Students understand the ways 
that human activities impacts Earth’s other systems. Students can use many different 
practices to understand the significant and complex issues surrounding human uses of 
land, energy, mineral, and water resources and the resulting impacts of their 
development. The crosscutting concepts of patterns; cause and effect; and 
interdependence of science, engineering, and technology are called out as organizing 
concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.

Middle School Engineering Design 

 

 
By the time students reach middle school they should have had numerous experiences in 
engineering design.  The goal for middle school students is to define problems more 
precisely, to conduct a more thorough process of choosing the best solution, and to 
optimize the final design.   

Defining the problem with “precision” involves thinking more deeply than is expected in 
elementary school about the needs a problem is intended to address, or the goals a 
design is intended to reach. How will the end user decide whether or not the design is 
successful? Also at this level students are expected to consider not only the end user, but 
also the broader society and the environment.  Every technological change is likely to 
have both intended and unintended effects.  It is up to the designer to try to anticipate 
the effects it may have, and to behave responsibly in developing a new or improved 
technology.  These considerations may take the form of either criteria or constraints on 
possible solutions. 

Developing possible solutions does not explicitly address generating design ideas 
since students were expected to develop the capability in elementary school.  The focus in 
middle school is on a two stage process of evaluating the different ideas that have been 
proposed: by using a systematic method, such as a tradeoff matrix, to determine which 
solutions are most promising, and by testing different solutions, and then combining the 
best ideas into new solution that may be better than any of the preliminary ideas.  

Improving designs at the middle school level involves an iterative process in which 
students test the best design, analyze the results, modify the design accordingly, and then 
re-test and modify the design again.  Students may go through this cycle two, three, or 
more times in order to reach the optimal (best possible) result.  

Connections with other science disciplines help students develop these capabilities in 
various contexts.  For example, in the life sciences students apply their engineering design 
capabilities to evaluate plans for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services (MS-LS2-
5). In the physical sciences students define and solve problems involving a number of core 
ideas in physical science, including: chemical processes that release or absorb energy 
(MS-PS1-6), Newton’s third law of motion (MS-PS2-1), and energy transfer (MS-PS3-3). In 
the Earth and space sciences students apply their engineering design capabilities to 
problems related the impacts of humans on Earth systems (MS-ESS3-3).  

By the end of 8th grade students are expected to achieve all four performance 
expectations (MS-ETS1-1, MS-ETS1-2, MS-ETS1-3, and MS-ETS1-4) related to a single 
problem in order to understand the interrelated processes of engineering design.  These 
include defining a problem by precisely specifying criteria and constraints for solutions as 
well as potential impacts on society and the natural environment, systematically 
evaluating alternative solutions, analyzing data from tests of different solutions and 
combining the best ideas into an improved solution, and developing a model and 
iteratively testing and improving it to reach an optimal solution. While the performance 
expectations shown in Middle School Engineering Design couple particular practices with 
specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional decisions should include use of many practices 
that lead to the performance expectations.

MS.Structure and Properties of Matter 
Students who demonstrate understanding can:   
MS-PS1-1.  Develop models to describe the atomic composition of simple molecules and extended structures.  [Clarification 

Statement:  Emphasis is on developing models of molecules that vary in complexity. Examples of simple molecules could include ammonia and methanol. Examples 
of extended structures could include sodium chloride or diamonds. Examples of molecular-level models could include drawings, 3D ball and stick structures, or 
computer representations showing different molecules with different types of atoms.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include valence electrons and 
bonding energy, discussing the ionic nature of subunits of complex structures, or a complete depiction of all individual atoms in a complex molecule or extended 
structure.] 

MS-PS1-3.  Gather and make sense of information to describe that synthetic materials come from natural resources and 

impact society.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on natural resources that undergo a chemical process to form the synthetic material. Examples of new 
materials could include new medicine, foods, and alternative fuels.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to qualitative information.]  

MS-PS1-4.  Develop a model that predicts and describes changes in particle motion, temperature, and state of a pure 

substance when thermal energy is added or removed.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on qualitative molecular-level models of solids, 
liquids, and gases to show that adding or removing thermal energy increases or decreases kinetic energy of the particles until a change of state occurs. Examples of 
models could include drawings and diagrams. Examples of particles could include molecules or inert atoms. Examples of pure substances could include water, carbon 
dioxide, and helium.]   
The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education:

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

Developing and Using Models 
Modeling in 6–8 builds on K–5 and progresses to 
developing, using and revising models to describe, test, 
and predict more abstract phenomena and design 
systems. 
  Develop a model to predict and/or describe 

phenomena. (MS-PS1-1),(MS-PS1-4) 

Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating 
Information  
Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information in 
6–8 builds on K–5 and progresses to evaluating the merit 
and validity of ideas and methods. 
  Gather, read, and synthesize information from 

multiple appropriate sources and assess the 
credibility, accuracy, and possible bias of each 
publication and methods used, and describe how 
they are supported or not supported by evidence. 
(MS-PS1-3) 

PS1.A:  Structure and Properties of Matter 
  Substances are made from different types of atoms, which 

combine with one another in various ways. Atoms form 
molecules that range in size from two to thousands of atoms. 
(MS-PS1-1) 

  Each pure substance has characteristic physical and chemical 
properties (for any bulk quantity under given conditions) that 
can be used to identify it. (MS-PS1-3) (Note: This Disciplinary 
Core Idea is also addressed by MS-PS1-2.) 

  Gases and liquids are made of molecules or inert atoms that are 

moving about relative to each other. (MS-PS1-4) 

  In a liquid, the molecules are constantly in contact with others; 

in a gas, they are widely spaced except when they happen to 
collide. In a solid, atoms are closely spaced and may vibrate in 
position but do not change relative locations. (MS-PS1-4) 

  Solids may be formed from molecules, or they may be extended 

structures with repeating subunits (e.g., crystals). (MS-PS1-1) 
  The changes of state that occur with variations in temperature 
or pressure can be described and predicted using these models 
of matter. (MS-PS1-4) 

PS1.B:  Chemical Reactions 
  Substances react chemically in characteristic ways.  In a 

chemical process, the atoms that make up the original 
substances are regrouped into different molecules, and these 
new substances have different properties from those of the 
reactants. (MS-PS1-3) (Note: This Disciplinary Core Idea is also 
addressed by MS-PS1-2 and MS-PS1-5.) 

PS3.A:  Definitions of Energy 
  The term “heat” as used in everyday language refers both to 

thermal energy (the motion of atoms or molecules within a 
substance) and the transfer of that thermal energy from one 
object to another. In science, heat is used only for this second 
meaning; it refers to the energy transferred due to the 
temperature difference between two objects. (secondary to MS-
PS1-4) 

  The temperature of a system is proportional to the average 

internal kinetic energy and potential energy per atom or 
molecule (whichever is the appropriate building block for the 
system’s material). The details of that relationship depend on 
the type of atom or molecule and the interactions among the 
atoms in the material. Temperature is not a direct measure of a 
system's total thermal energy. The total thermal energy 
(sometimes called the total internal energy) of a system depends 
jointly on the temperature, the total number of atoms in the 
system, and the state of the material. (secondary to MS-PS1-4) 

Cause and Effect  
  Cause and effect relationships may be used to 

predict phenomena in natural or designed 
systems. (MS-PS1-4) 

Scale, Proportion, and Quantity 
  Time, space, and energy phenomena can be 

observed at various scales using models to 
study systems that are too large or too small. 
(MS-PS1-1) 

Structure and Function 
  Structures can be designed to serve particular 
functions by taking into account properties of 
different materials, and how materials can be 
shaped and used. (MS-PS1-3) 

 

------------------------------------------------ 
Connections to Engineering, Technology,	

and Applications of Science	

 
Interdependence of Science, Engineering, 
and Technology 
  Engineering advances have led to important 
discoveries in virtually every field of science, 
and scientific discoveries have led to the 
development of entire industries and 
engineered systems. (MS-PS1-3) 

Influence of Science, Engineering and 
Technology on Society and the Natural 
World 
  The uses of technologies and any limitations 

on their use are driven by individual or 
societal needs, desires, and values; by the 
findings of scientific research; and by 
differences in such factors as climate, natural 
resources, and economic conditions. Thus 
technology use varies from region to region 
and over time. (MS-PS1-3)

Integrate quantitative or technical information expressed in words in a text with a version of that information expressed visually (e.g., in a flowchart, diagram, 
model, graph, or table). (MS-PS1-1),(MS-PS1-4) 
Gather relevant information from multiple print and digital sources, using search terms effectively; assess the credibility and accuracy of each source; and quote 
or paraphrase the data and conclusions of others while avoiding plagiarism and following a standard format for citation. (MS-PS1-3)

MS.Chemical Reactions 
Students who demonstrate understanding can:   
MS-PS1-2.  Analyze and interpret data on the properties of substances before and after the substances interact to determine 

if a chemical reaction has occurred.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of reactions could include burning sugar or steel wool, fat reacting with

thus mass is conserved.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on law of conservation of matter and on physical models or drawings, including digital 
forms, that represent atoms.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include the use of atomic masses, balancing symbolic equations, or intermolecular 
forces.]   

MS-PS1-6.  Undertake a design project to construct, test, and modify a device that either releases or absorbs thermal energy 
by chemical processes.*  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the design, controlling the transfer of energy to the environment, and modification of a 
device using factors such as type and concentration of a substance. Examples of designs could involve chemical reactions such as dissolving ammonium chloride or 
calcium chloride.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to the criteria of amount, time, and temperature of substance in testing the device.]

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

Patterns 
  Macroscopic patterns are related to the 
nature of microscopic and atomic-level 
structure. (MS-PS1-2) 

Energy and Matter  
  Matter is conserved because atoms are 

conserved in physical and chemical processes. 
(MS-PS1-5) 

  The transfer of energy can be tracked as 

energy flows through a designed or natural 
system. (MS-PS1-6) 

 

 
 

PS1.A:  Structure and Properties of Matter 
  Each pure substance has characteristic physical and chemical 
properties (for any bulk quantity under given conditions) that 
can be used to identify it. (MS-PS1-2) (Note: This Disciplinary 
Core Idea is also addressed by MS-PS1-3.) 

PS1.B:  Chemical Reactions 
  Substances react chemically in characteristic ways.  In a 

chemical process, the atoms that make up the original 
substances are regrouped into different molecules, and these 
new substances have different properties from those of the 
reactants. (MS-PS1-2),(MS-PS1-5) (Note: This Disciplinary Core 
Idea is also addressed by MS-PS1-3.) 

  The total number of each type of atom is conserved, and thus 

the mass does not change. (MS-PS1-5) 

  Some chemical reactions release energy, others store energy. 

(MS-PS1-6) 

ETS1.B:  Developing Possible Solutions 

  A solution needs to be tested, and then modified on the basis of 
the test results, in order to improve it. (secondary to MS-PS1-6) 

ETS1.C:  Optimizing the Design Solution 
  Although one design may not perform the best across all tests, 
identifying the characteristics of the design that performed the 
best in each test can provide useful information for the redesign 
process—that is, some of the characteristics may be 
incorporated into the new design. (secondary to MS-PS1-6) 

  The iterative process of testing the most promising solutions and 
modifying what is proposed on the basis of the test results leads 
to greater refinement and ultimately to an optimal solution. 
(secondary to MS-PS1-6) 

Developing and Using Models 
Modeling in 6–8 builds on K–5 and progresses to 
developing, using and revising models to describe, test, 
and predict more abstract phenomena and design 
systems. 
  Develop a model to describe unobservable 

mechanisms. (MS-PS1-5) 

Analyzing and Interpreting Data 
Analyzing data in 6–8 builds on K–5 and progresses to 
extending quantitative analysis to investigations, 
distinguishing between correlation and causation, and 
basic statistical techniques of data and error analysis. 
  Analyze and interpret data to determine similarities 

and differences in findings. (MS-PS1-2) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing 
Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 6–8 
builds on K–5 experiences and progresses to include 
constructing explanations and designing solutions 
supported by multiple sources of evidence consistent with 
scientific knowledge, principles, and theories. 
  Undertake a design project, engaging in the design 
cycle, to construct and/or implement a solution that 
meets specific design criteria and constraints. (MS-
PS1-6)

Connections to Nature of Science 

Scientific Knowledge is Based on Empirical 
Evidence 
  Science knowledge is based upon logical and 

conceptual connections between evidence and 
explanations. (MS-PS1-2) 

Science Models, Laws, Mechanisms, and Theories 
Explain Natural Phenomena

MS.Forces and Interactions 
Students who demonstrate understanding can: 
MS-PS2-1.  Apply Newton’s Third Law to design a solution to a problem involving the motion of two colliding objects.*   
[Clarification Statement:  Examples of practical problems could include the impact of collisions between two cars, between a car and stationary objects, and 
between a meteor and a space vehicle.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to vertical or horizontal interactions in one dimension.] 

MS-PS2-2.  Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object’s motion depends on the sum of the 

forces on the object and the mass of the object.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on balanced (Newton’s First Law) and unbalanced 
forces in a system, qualitative comparisons of forces, mass and changes in motion (Newton’s Second Law), frame of reference, and specification of units.] 
[Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to forces and changes in motion in one-dimension in an inertial reference frame and to change in one variable at a 
time. Assessment does not include the use of trigonometry.] 

MS-PS2-3.  Ask questions about data to determine the factors that affect the strength of electric and magnetic forces.  
[Clarification Statement:  Examples of devices that use electric and magnetic forces could include electromagnets, electric motors, or generators. Examples of 
data could include the effect of the number of turns of wire on the strength of an electromagnet, or the effect of increasing the number or strength of magnets 
on the speed of an electric motor.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment about questions that require quantitative answers is limited to proportional reasoning and 
algebraic thinking.] 

MS-PS2-4.  Construct and present arguments using evidence to support the claim that gravitational interactions are 

attractive and depend on the masses of interacting objects.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of evidence for arguments could 
include data generated from simulations or digital tools; and charts displaying mass, strength of interaction, distance from the Sun, and orbital periods of objects 
within the solar system.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include Newton’s Law of Gravitation or Kepler’s Laws.] 

MS-PS2-5.  Conduct an investigation and evaluate the experimental design to provide evidence that fields exist between 

objects exerting forces on each other even though the objects are not in contact.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of this 
phenomenon could include the interactions of magnets, electrically-charged strips of tape, and electrically-charged pith balls. Examples of investigations could 
include first-hand experiences or simulations.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to electric and magnetic fields, and is limited to qualitative evidence 
for the existence of fields.] 

The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education:

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

Asking Questions and Defining Problems 
Asking questions and defining problems in grades 6–8 builds from grades 
K–5 experiences and progresses to specifying relationships between 
variables, and clarifying arguments and models. 
  Ask questions that can be investigated within the scope of the 

classroom, outdoor environment, and museums and other public 
facilities with available resources and, when appropriate, frame a 
hypothesis based on observations and scientific principles. (MS-PS2-3) 

Planning and Carrying Out Investigations 
Planning and carrying out investigations to answer questions or test 
solutions to problems in 6–8 builds on K–5 experiences and progresses to 
include investigations that use multiple variables and provide evidence to 
support explanations or design solutions. 
  Plan an investigation individually and collaboratively, and in the design: 
identify independent and dependent variables and controls, what tools 
are needed to do the gathering, how measurements will be recorded, 
and how many data are needed to support a claim. (MS-PS2-2) 

  Conduct an investigation and evaluate the experimental design to 
produce data to serve as the basis for evidence that can meet the 
goals of the investigation. (MS-PS2-5) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 6–8 builds on K–5 
experiences and progresses to include constructing explanations and 
designing solutions supported by multiple sources of evidence consistent 
with scientific ideas, principles, and theories. 
  Apply scientific ideas or principles to design an object, tool, process or 

system. (MS-PS2-1) 

Engaging in Argument from Evidence 
Engaging in argument from evidence in 6–8 builds from K–5 experiences 
and progresses to constructing a convincing argument that supports or 
refutes claims for either explanations or solutions about the natural and 
designed world.  
  Construct and present oral and written arguments supported by 

empirical evidence and scientific reasoning to support or refute an 
explanation or a model for a phenomenon or a solution to a problem. 
(MS-PS2-4) 

PS2.A:  Forces and Motion 
  For any pair of interacting objects, the force 

exerted by the first object on the second object is 
equal in strength to the force that the second 
object exerts on the first, but in the opposite 
direction (Newton’s third law). (MS-PS2-1) 

  The motion of an object is determined by the sum 
of the forces acting on it; if the total force on the 
object is not zero, its motion will change. The 
greater the mass of the object, the greater the 
force needed to achieve the same change in 
motion. For any given object, a larger force 
causes a larger change in motion. (MS-PS2-2) 

  All positions of objects and the directions of forces 

and motions must be described in an arbitrarily 
chosen reference frame and arbitrarily chosen 
units of size. In order to share information with 
other people, these choices must also be shared. 
(MS-PS2-2) 

PS2.B:  Types of Interactions 
  Electric and magnetic (electromagnetic) forces can 

be attractive or repulsive, and their sizes depend 
on the magnitudes of the charges, currents, or 
magnetic strengths involved and on the distances 
between the interacting objects. (MS-PS2-3) 

  Gravitational forces are always attractive. There is 
a gravitational force between any two masses, but 
it is very small except when one or both of the 
objects have large mass—e.g., Earth and the sun. 
(MS-PS2-4) 

  Forces that act at a distance (electric, magnetic, 
and gravitational) can be explained by fields that 
extend through space and can be mapped by their 
effect on a test object (a charged object, or a ball, 
respectively). (MS-PS2-5) 

 

Cause and Effect 
  Cause and effect relationships may be 

used to predict phenomena in natural or 
designed systems. (MS-PS2-3),(MS-PS2-
5) 

Systems and System Models 
  Models can be used to represent systems 

and their interactions—such as inputs, 
processes and outputs—and energy and 
matter flows within systems. (MS-PS2-
1),(MS-PS2-4),  

Stability and Change 
  Explanations of stability and change in 

natural or designed systems can be 
constructed by examining the changes 
over time and forces at different scales. 
(MS-PS2-2) 

----------------------------------------------
Connections to Engineering, Technology,

and Applications of Science	

 
Influence of Science, Engineering, and 
Technology on Society and the Natural 
World 
  The uses of technologies and any 

limitations on their use are driven by 
individual or societal needs, desires, and 
values; by the findings of scientific 
research; and by differences in such 
factors as climate, natural resources, and 
economic conditions. (MS-PS2-1)

MS.Energy 
Students who demonstrate understanding can: 
MS-PS3-1.  Construct and interpret graphical displays of data to describe the relationships of kinetic energy to the mass of an 
object and to the speed of an object.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on descriptive relationships between kinetic energy and mass separately 
from kinetic energy and speed. Examples could include riding a bicycle at different speeds, rolling different sizes of rocks downhill, and getting hit by a wiffle ball 
versus a tennis ball.] 

MS-PS3-2.  Develop a model to describe that when the arrangement of objects interacting at a distance changes, different 

amounts of potential energy are stored in the system.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on relative amounts of potential energy, not on 
calculations of potential energy. Examples of objects within systems interacting at varying distances could include: the Earth and either a roller coaster cart at varying 
positions on a hill or objects at varying heights on shelves, changing the direction/orientation of a magnet, and a balloon with static electrical charge being brought 
closer to a classmate’s hair. Examples of models could include representations, diagrams, pictures, and written descriptions of systems.] [Assessment Boundary:  
Assessment is limited to two objects and electric, magnetic, and gravitational interactions.]  

MS-PS3-3.  Apply scientific principles to design, construct, and test a device that either minimizes or maximizes thermal 

energy transfer.*  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of devices could include an insulated box, a solar cooker, and a Styrofoam cup.] [Assessment 
Boundary:  Assessment does not include calculating the total amount of thermal energy transferred.] 

MS-PS3-4.  Plan an investigation to determine the relationships among the energy transferred, the type of matter, the mass, 

and the change in the average kinetic energy of the particles as measured by the temperature of the sample.   
[Clarification Statement:  Examples of experiments could include comparing final water temperatures after different masses of ice melted in the same volume of water 
with the same initial temperature, the temperature change of samples of different materials with the same mass as they cool or heat in the environment, or the same 
material with different masses when a specific amount of energy is added.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include calculating the total amount of 
thermal energy transferred.] 

MS-PS3-5.  Construct, use, and present arguments to support the claim that when the kinetic energy of an object changes, 

energy is transferred to or from the object.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of empirical evidence used in arguments could include an 
inventory or other representation of the energy before and after the transfer in the form of temperature changes or motion of object.] [Assessment Boundary:  
Assessment does not include calculations of energy.]

analysis to investigations, distinguishing between correlation and causation, 
and basic statistical techniques of data and error analysis. 
  Construct and interpret graphical displays of data to identify linear and 

nonlinear relationships. (MS-PS3-1)

scientific ideas, principles, and theories. 
  Apply scientific ideas or principles to design, construct, and test a design 

of an object, tool, process or system. (MS-PS3-3)

------------------------------------------------- 

Connections to Nature of Science  

 

Scientific Knowledge is Based on Empirical Evidence 
  Science knowledge is based upon logical and conceptual connections 

between evidence and explanations (MS-PS3-4),(MS-PS3-5) 

Scale, Proportion, and Quantity 
  Proportional relationships (e.g. speed 

as the ratio of distance traveled to 
time taken) among different types of 
quantities provide information about 
the magnitude of properties and 
processes. (MS-PS3-1),(MS-PS3-4) 

Systems and System Models 
  Models can be used to represent 

systems and their interactions – such 
as inputs, processes, and outputs – 
and energy and matter flows within 
systems. (MS-PS3-2) 

Energy and Matter  
  Energy may take different forms 

(e.g. energy in fields, thermal 
energy, energy of motion). (MS-PS3-
5) 

  The transfer of energy can be 

tracked as energy flows through a 
designed or natural system. (MS-
PS3-3) 

 

 

 

PS3.A:  Definitions of Energy  
  Motion energy is properly called kinetic energy; it is 
proportional to the mass of the moving object and 
grows with the square of its speed. (MS-PS3-1) 

  A system of objects may also contain stored 

(potential) energy, depending on their relative 
positions. (MS-PS3-2) 

  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic 

energy of particles of matter. The relationship between 
the temperature and the total energy of a system 
depends on the types, states, and amounts of matter 
present. (MS-PS3-3),(MS-PS3-4) 

PS3.B:  Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer 
  When the motion energy of an object changes, there 
is inevitably some other change in energy at the same 
time. (MS-PS3-5) 

  The amount of energy transfer needed to change the 

temperature of a matter sample by a given amount 
depends on the nature of the matter, the size of the 
sample, and the environment. (MS-PS3-4) 

  Energy is spontaneously transferred out of hotter 

regions or objects and into colder ones. (MS-PS3-3) 
PS3.C:  Relationship Between Energy and Forces 
  When two objects interact, each one exerts a force on 
the other that can cause energy to be transferred to or 
from the object. (MS-PS3-2) 

ETS1.A:  Defining and Delimiting an Engineering 
Problem 
  The more precisely a design task’s criteria and 

constraints can be defined, the more likely it is that 
the designed solution will be successful. Specification 
of constraints includes consideration of scientific 
principles and other relevant knowledge that is likely 
to limit possible solutions. (secondary to MS-PS3-3) 

ETS1.B:  Developing Possible Solutions 
  A solution needs to be tested, and then modified on 

the basis of the test results in order to improve it. 
There are systematic processes for evaluating 
solutions with respect to how well they meet criteria 
and constraints of a problem. (secondary to MS-PS3-3)

except at surfaces between different transparent materials 
(e.g., air and water, air and glass) where the light path bends.

  A wave model of light is useful for explaining brightness, color, 

and the frequency-dependent bending of light at a surface 
between media. (MS-PS4-2)

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Developing and Using Models 
Modeling in 6–8 builds on K–5 experiences and 
progresses to developing, using, and revising models to 
describe, test, and predict more abstract phenomena and 
design systems. 
  Develop a model to describe phenomena. (MS-LS2-3) 
  Develop a model to describe unobservable 

mechanisms. (MS-LS1-7)

progresses to extending quantitative analysis to 
investigations, distinguishing between correlation and 
causation, and basic statistical techniques of data and 
error analysis.  
  Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence for 

phenomena. (MS-LS2-1) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing 
Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 6–8 
builds on K–5 experiences and progresses to include 
constructing explanations and designing solutions 
supported by multiple sources of evidence consistent 
with scientific knowledge, principles, and theories. 
  Construct a scientific explanation based on valid and 

reliable evidence obtained from sources (including 
the students’ own experiments) and the assumption 
that theories and laws that describe the natural 
world operate today as they did in the past and will 
continue to do so in the future. (MS-LS1-6) 

Engaging in Argument from Evidence 
Engaging in argument from evidence in 6–8 builds on K–
5 experiences and progresses to constructing a 
convincing argument that supports or refutes claims for 
either explanations or solutions about the natural and 
designed world(s). 
  Construct an oral and written argument supported by 
empirical evidence and scientific reasoning to support 
or refute an explanation or a model for a 
phenomenon or a solution to a problem. (MS-LS2-4) 
 
---------------------------------------------------- 

Connections to Nature of Science  

 
Scientific Knowledge is Based on Empirical 
Evidence 
  Science knowledge is based upon logical connections 

between evidence and explanations. (MS-LS1-6) 

  Science disciplines share common rules of obtaining 

and evaluating empirical evidence. (MS-LS2-4) 

Crosscutting Concepts 

Cause and Effect 
  Cause and effect relationships may be used 
to predict phenomena in natural or designed 
systems. (MS-LS2-1) 

Energy and Matter  
  Matter is conserved because atoms are 

conserved in physical and chemical 
processes. (MS-LS1-7) 

  Within a natural system, the transfer of 

energy drives the motion and/or cycling of 
matter. (MS-LS1-6) 

  The transfer of energy can be tracked as 

energy flows through a natural system. (MS-
LS2-3) 

Stability and Change 
  Small changes in one part of a system might 

cause large changes in another part. (MS-
LS2-4) 

 
-------------------------------------------------- 

Connections to Nature of Science  

 
Scientific Knowledge Assumes an Order 
and Consistency in Natural Systems 
  Science assumes that objects and events in 
natural systems occur in consistent patterns 
that are understandable through 
measurement and observation. (MS-LS2-3) 

 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

LS1.C:  Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms 
  Plants, algae (including phytoplankton), and many 

microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) 
from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the 
process of photosynthesis, which also releases oxygen. These 
sugars can be used immediately or stored for growth or later use. 
(MS-LS1-6) 

  Within individual organisms, food moves through a series of 

chemical reactions in which it is broken down and rearranged to 
form new molecules, to support growth, or to release energy. 
(MS-LS1-7)  

LS2.A:  Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems 
  Organisms, and populations of organisms, are dependent on their 
environmental interactions both with other living things and with 
nonliving factors. (MS-LS2-1) 

  In any ecosystem, organisms and populations with similar 

requirements for food, water, oxygen, or other resources may 
compete with each other for limited resources, access to which 
consequently constrains their growth and reproduction. (MS-LS2-
1) 

  Growth of organisms and population increases are limited by 

access to resources. (MS-LS2-1) 

LS2.B:  Cycle of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems 
  Food webs are models that demonstrate how matter and energy 
is transferred between producers, consumers, and decomposers 
as the three groups interact within an ecosystem. Transfers of 
matter into and out of the physical environment occur at every 
level. Decomposers recycle nutrients from dead plant or animal 
matter back to the soil in terrestrial environments or to the water 
in aquatic environments. The atoms that make up the organisms 
in an ecosystem are cycled repeatedly between the living and 
nonliving parts of the ecosystem. (MS-LS2-3) 

LS2.C:  Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience  
  Ecosystems are dynamic in nature; their characteristics can vary 
over time. Disruptions to any physical or biological component of 
an ecosystem can lead to shifts in all its populations. (MS-LS2-4) 

PS3.D:  Energy in Chemical Processes and Everyday Life 
  The chemical reaction by which plants produce complex food 

molecules (sugars) requires an energy input (i.e., from sunlight) 
to occur. In this reaction, carbon dioxide and water combine to 
form carbon-based organic molecules and release oxygen. 
(secondary to MS-LS1-6) 

  Cellular respiration in plants and animals involve chemical 
reactions with oxygen that release stored energy. In these 
processes, complex molecules containing carbon react with 
oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and other materials. (secondary 
to MS-LS1-7)

  Similarly, predatory interactions may reduce the number of 

organisms or eliminate whole populations of organisms. Mutually 
beneficial interactions, in contrast, may become so interdependent 
that each organism requires the other for survival. Although the 
species involved in these competitive, predatory, and mutually 
beneficial interactions vary across ecosystems, the patterns of 
interactions of organisms with their environments, both living and 
nonliving, are shared. (MS-LS2-2)

Influence of Science, Engineering, and 
Technology on Society and the Natural 
World 
  The use of technologies and any limitations 

on their use are driven by individual or 
societal needs, desires, and values; by the 
findings of scientific research; and by 
differences in such factors as climate, 
natural resources, and economic 
conditions. Thus technology use varies 
from region to region and over time. (MS-

MS.Growth, Development, and Reproduction of Organisms 
Students who demonstrate understanding can: 
MS-LS1-4.  Use argument based on empirical evidence and scientific reasoning to support an explanation for how 

characteristic animal behaviors and specialized plant structures affect the probability of successful reproduction 
of animals and plants respectively.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of behaviors that affect the probability of animal reproduction could include 
nest building to protect young from cold, herding of animals to protect young from predators, and vocalization of animals and colorful plumage to attract mates for 
breeding. Examples of animal behaviors that affect the probability of plant reproduction could include transferring pollen or seeds, and creating conditions for seed 
germination and growth. Examples of plant structures could include bright flowers attracting butterflies that transfer pollen, flower nectar and odors that attract 
insects that transfer pollen, and hard shells on nuts that squirrels bury.]   

MS-LS1-5.  Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for how environmental and genetic factors influence the 
growth of organisms.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of local environmental conditions could include availability of food, light, space, and water.  
Examples of genetic factors could include large breed cattle and species of grass affecting growth of organisms. Examples of evidence could include drought 
decreasing plant growth, fertilizer increasing plant growth, different varieties of plant seeds growing at different rates in different conditions, and fish growing larger 
in large ponds than they do in small ponds.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include genetic mechanisms, gene regulation, or biochemical processes.] 
MS-LS3-1.  Develop and use a model to describe why structural changes to genes (mutations) located on chromosomes may 

affect proteins and may result in harmful, beneficial, or neutral effects to the structure and function of the 
organism.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on conceptual understanding that changes in genetic material may result in making different proteins.] 
[Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include specific changes at the molecular level, mechanisms for protein synthesis, or specific types of mutations.] 

MS-LS3-2.  Develop and use a model to describe why asexual reproduction results in offspring with identical genetic 

information and sexual reproduction results in offspring with genetic variation.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on using 
models such as Punnett squares, diagrams, and simulations to describe the cause and effect relationship of gene transmission from parent(s) to offspring and 
resulting genetic variation.] 

MS-LS4-5.  Gather and synthesize information about the technologies that have changed the way humans influence the 

inheritance of desired traits in organisms.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on synthesizing information from reliable sources about the 
influence of humans on genetic outcomes in artificial selection (such as genetic modification, animal husbandry, gene therapy); and, on the impacts these 
technologies have on society as well as the technologies leading to these scientific discoveries.]

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 6–8 
builds on K–5 experiences and progresses to include 
constructing explanations and designing solutions supported 
by multiple sources of evidence consistent with scientific 
knowledge, principles, and theories. 
  Construct a scientific explanation based on valid and 

reliable evidence obtained from sources (including the 
students’ own experiments) and the assumption that 
theories and laws that describe the natural world operate 
today as they did in the past and will continue to do so in 
the future. (MS-LS1-5) 

Engaging in Argument from Evidence 
Engaging in argument from evidence in 6–8 builds on K–5 
experiences and progresses to constructing a convincing 
argument that supports or refutes claims for either 
explanations or solutions about the natural and designed 
world(s).

builds on K–5 experiences and progresses to evaluating the 
merit and validity of ideas and methods. 
  Gather, read, and synthesize information from multiple 
appropriate sources and assess the credibility, accuracy, 
and possible bias of each publication and methods used, 
and describe how they are supported or not supported by 
evidence. (MS-LS4-5) 
 

odds of reproduction. (MS-LS1-4) 

  Plants reproduce in a variety of ways, sometimes depending 

on animal behavior and specialized features for 
reproduction. (MS-LS1-4) 

  Genetic factors as well as local conditions affect the growth 

of the adult plant. (MS-LS1-5) 

LS3.A:  Inheritance of Traits 
  Genes are located in the chromosomes of cells, with each 
chromosome pair containing two variants of each of many 
distinct genes. Each distinct gene chiefly controls the 
production of specific proteins, which in turn affects the 
traits of the individual.  Changes (mutations) to genes can 
result in changes to proteins, which can affect the structures 
and functions of the organism and thereby change traits. 
(MS-LS3-1) 

  Variations of inherited traits between parent and offspring 

arise from genetic differences that result from the subset of 
chromosomes (and therefore genes) inherited. (MS-LS3-2) 

LS3.B:  Variation of Traits  
  In sexually reproducing organisms, each parent contributes 

half of the genes acquired (at random) by the offspring. 
Individuals have two of each chromosome and hence two 
alleles of each gene, one acquired from each parent. These 
versions may be identical or may differ from each other. 
(MS-LS3-2) 

  In addition to variations that arise from sexual reproduction, 

genetic information can be altered because of mutations. 
Though rare, mutations may result in changes to the 
structure and function of proteins. Some changes are 
beneficial, others harmful, and some neutral to the 
organism. (MS-LS3-1) 

LS4.B:  Natural Selection 
  In artificial selection, humans have the capacity to influence 

certain characteristics of organisms by selective breeding. 
One can choose desired parental traits determined by 
genes, which are then passed on to offspring. (MS-LS4-5)

and some cause and effect relationships in 
systems can only be described using 
probability. (MS-LS1-4),(MS-LS1-5),(MS-LS4-
5) 

Structure and Function 
  Complex and microscopic structures and 

systems can be visualized, modeled, and used 
to describe how their function depends on the 
shapes, composition, and relationships among 
its parts, therefore complex natural 
structures/systems can be analyzed to 
determine how they function. (MS-LS3-1)

Crosscutting Concepts 

LS4.A:  Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity  
  The collection of fossils and their placement in chronological 
order (e.g., through the location of the sedimentary layers in 
which they are found or through radioactive dating) is known 
as the fossil record. It documents the existence, diversity, 
extinction, and change of many life forms throughout the 
history of life on Earth. (MS-LS4-1) 

  Anatomical similarities and differences between various 

organisms living today and between them and organisms in 
the fossil record, enable the reconstruction of evolutionary 
history and the inference of lines of evolutionary descent. 
(MS-LS4-2) 

  Comparison of the embryological development of different 
species also reveals similarities that show relationships not 
evident in the fully-formed anatomy. (MS-LS4-3)  

LS4.B:  Natural Selection 
  Natural selection leads to the predominance of certain traits 
in a population, and the suppression of others. (MS-LS4-4) 

LS4.C:  Adaptation  
  Adaptation by natural selection acting over generations is 

one important process by which species change over time in 
response to changes in environmental conditions. Traits that 
support successful survival and reproduction in the new 
environment become more common; those that do not 
become less common. Thus, the distribution of traits in a 
population changes. (MS-LS4-6) 

	

Patterns  
  Patterns can be used to identify cause 

and effect relationships.  (MS-LS4-2) 

  Graphs, charts, and images can be used 
to identify patterns in data. (MS-LS4-1),

cause, and some cause and effect 
relationships in systems can only be 
described using probability. (MS-LS4-

  Analyze displays of data to identify linear and 

nonlinear relationships. (MS-LS4-3) 

  Analyze and interpret data to determine similarities 

and differences in findings. (MS-LS4-1) 

Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking 
Mathematical and computational thinking in 6–8 builds on 
K–5 experiences and progresses to identifying patterns in 
large data sets and using mathematical concepts to 
support explanations and arguments. 
  Use mathematical representations to support scientific 

conclusions and design solutions. (MS-LS4-6)

 ESS1.A:  The Universe and Its Stars 
  Patterns of the apparent motion of the sun, the moon, and stars 
in the sky can be observed, described, predicted, and explained 
with models. (MS-ESS1-1) 

  Earth and its solar system are part of the Milky Way galaxy, which 

is one of many galaxies in the universe. (MS-ESS1-2) 

ESS1.B:  Earth and the Solar System

including planets, their moons, and asteroids that are held in orbit 
around the sun by its gravitational pull on them. (MS-ESS1-
2),(MS-ESS1-3) 

  This model of the solar system can explain eclipses of the sun and 

the moon.  Earth’s spin axis is fixed in direction over the short-
term but tilted relative to its orbit around the sun. The seasons 
are a result of that tilt and are caused by the differential intensity 
of sunlight on different areas of Earth across the year. (MS-ESS1-

Science and Engineering Practices 

Analyzing and Interpreting Data 
Analyzing data in 6–8 builds on K–5 and progresses to extending 
quantitative analysis to investigations, distinguishing between 
correlation and causation, and basic statistical techniques of 
data and error analysis.  
  Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence for 

phenomena. (MS-ESS2-3) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 6–8 builds 
on K–5 experiences and progresses to include constructing 
explanations and designing solutions supported by multiple 
sources of evidence consistent with scientific ideas, principles, 
and theories. 
  Construct a scientific explanation based on valid and reliable 

evidence obtained from sources (including the students’ 
own experiments) and the assumption that theories and 
laws that describe the natural world operate today as they 
did in the past and will continue to do so in the future. (MS-

to organize Earth’s history. Analyses of rock strata and the fossil 
record provide only relative dates, not an absolute scale. (MS-ESS1-
4) 

  Tectonic processes continually generate new ocean sea floor at 
ridges and destroy old sea floor at trenches. (HS.ESS1.C GBE) 
(secondary to MS-ESS2-3) 

ESS2.A:  Earth’s Materials and Systems 
  The planet’s systems interact over scales that range from 

microscopic to global in size, and they operate over fractions of a 
second to billions of years. These interactions have shaped Earth’s 
history and will determine its future. (MS-ESS2-2) 

ESS2.B:  Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System Interactions 
  Maps of ancient land and water patterns, based on investigations of 
rocks and fossils, make clear how Earth’s plates have moved great 
distances, collided, and spread apart. (MS-ESS2-3) 

ESS2.C:  The Roles of Water in Earth’s Surface Processes 
  Water’s movements—both on the land and underground—cause 

weathering and erosion, which change the land’s surface features 
and create underground formations. (MS-ESS2-2) 

numerical relationships can provide 
information about natural systems. 
(MS-ESS2-3)  

Scale Proportion and Quantity 
  Time, space, and energy phenomena

MS.History of Earth 

organize Earth’s 4.6-billion-year-old history.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on how analyses of rock formations and the fossils they 
contain are used to establish relative ages of major events in Earth’s history. Examples of Earth’s major events could range from being very recent (such as the last 
Ice Age or the earliest fossils of homo sapiens) to very old (such as the formation of Earth or the earliest evidence of life). Examples can include the formation of 
mountain chains and ocean basins, the evolution or extinction of particular living organisms, or significant volcanic eruptions.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment 
does not include recalling the names of specific periods or epochs and events within them.] 

MS-ESS2-2.  Construct an explanation based on evidence for how geoscience processes have changed Earth’s surface at 

varying time and spatial scales.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on how processes change Earth’s surface at time and spatial scales that can be 
large (such as slow plate motions or the uplift of large mountain ranges) or small (such as rapid landslides or microscopic geochemical reactions), and how many 
geoscience processes (such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and meteor impacts) usually behave gradually but are punctuated by catastrophic events. Examples of 
geoscience processes include surface weathering and deposition by the movements of water, ice, and wind. Emphasis is on geoscience processes that shape local 
geographic features, where appropriate.] 

MS-ESS2-3.  Analyze and interpret data on the distribution of fossils and rocks, continental shapes, and seafloor structures to 
provide evidence of the past plate motions.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of data include similarities of rock and fossil types on different 
continents, the shapes of the continents (including continental shelves), and the locations of ocean structures (such as ridges, fracture zones, and trenches).] 
[Assessment Boundary:  Paleomagnetic anomalies in oceanic and continental crust are not assessed.]

ESS2.A:  Earth’s Materials and Systems 
  All Earth processes are the result of energy flowing and matter 
cycling within and among the planet’s systems. This energy is 
derived from the sun and Earth’s hot interior. The energy that 
flows and matter that cycles produce chemical and physical 
changes in Earth’s materials and living organisms. (MS-ESS2-1)

  Global movements of water and its changes in form are 

propelled by sunlight and gravity. (MS-ESS2-4) 

ESS3.A:  Natural Resources 
  Humans depend on Earth’s land, ocean, atmosphere, and 

biosphere for many different resources. Minerals, fresh water,

MS.Weather and Climate 
Students who demonstrate understanding can:  
MS-ESS2-5.  Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and complex interactions of air masses results in changes in 
weather conditions.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on how air masses flow from regions of high pressure to low pressure, causing weather (defined 
by temperature, pressure, humidity, precipitation, and wind) at a fixed location to change over time, and how sudden changes in weather can result when different air 
masses collide. Emphasis is on how weather can be predicted within probabilistic ranges. Examples of data can be provided to students (such as weather maps, 
diagrams, and visualizations) or obtained through laboratory experiments (such as with condensation).] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include 
recalling the names of cloud types or weather symbols used on weather maps or the reported diagrams from weather stations.] 

MS-ESS2-6.  Develop and use a model to describe how unequal heating and rotation of the Earth cause patterns of 

atmospheric and oceanic circulation that determine regional climates.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on how patterns vary by 
latitude, altitude, and geographic land distribution. Emphasis of atmospheric circulation is on the sunlight-driven latitudinal banding, the Coriolis effect, and resulting 
prevailing winds; emphasis of ocean circulation is on the transfer of heat by the global ocean convection cycle, which is constrained by the Coriolis effect and the 
outlines of continents. Examples of models can be diagrams, maps and globes, or digital representations.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include the 
dynamics of the Coriolis effect.] 

MS-ESS3-5.  Ask questions to clarify evidence of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures over the past 

century.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of factors include human activities (such as fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and agricultural activity) and 
natural processes (such as changes in incoming solar radiation or volcanic activity). Examples of evidence can include tables, graphs, and maps of global and regional 
temperatures, atmospheric levels of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and the rates of human activities. Emphasis is on the major role that human activities 
play in causing the rise in global temperatures.]

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

Asking Questions and Defining Problems 
Asking questions and defining problems in 6–8 builds on K–5 
experiences and progresses to specifying relationships between 
variables, and clarifying arguments and models. 
  Ask questions to identify and clarify evidence of an 

argument. (MS-ESS3-5) 

Developing and Using Models 
Modeling in 6–8 builds on K–5 experiences and progresses to 
developing, using, and revising models to describe, test, and 
predict more abstract phenomena and design systems. 
  Develop and use a model to describe phenomena. (MS-

ESS2-6) 

Planning and Carrying Out Investigations 
Planning and carrying out investigations in 6-8 builds on K-5 
experiences and progresses to include investigations that use 
multiple variables and provide evidence to support explanations 
or solutions. 
  Collect data to produce data to serve as the basis for 
evidence to answer scientific questions or test design 
solutions under a range of conditions. (MS-ESS2-5) 

 

 

Cause and Effect 
  Cause and effect relationships may be 
used to predict phenomena in natural 
or designed systems. (MS-ESS2-5) 

Systems and System Models 
  Models can be used to represent 

systems and their interactions—such 
as inputs, processes and outputs—and 
energy, matter, and information flows 
within systems. (MS-ESS2-6) 

Stability and Change 
  Stability might be disturbed either by 

sudden events or gradual changes that 
accumulate over time. (MS-ESS3-5) 

 
 

 

ESS2.C:  The Roles of Water in Earth’s Surface Processes 
  The complex patterns of the changes and the movement of water 

in the atmosphere, determined by winds, landforms, and ocean 
temperatures and currents, are major determinants of local 
weather patterns. (MS-ESS2-5) 

  Variations in density due to variations in temperature and salinity 
drive a global pattern of interconnected ocean currents. (MS-ESS2-
6) 

ESS2.D:  Weather and Climate 
  Weather and climate are influenced by interactions involving 

sunlight, the ocean, the atmosphere, ice, landforms, and living 
things. These interactions vary with latitude, altitude, and local and 
regional geography, all of which can affect oceanic and 
atmospheric flow patterns. (MS-ESS2-6) 

  Because these patterns are so complex, weather can only be 

predicted probabilistically. (MS-ESS2-5) 

  The ocean exerts a major influence on weather and climate by 

absorbing energy from the sun, releasing it over time, and globally 
redistributing it through ocean currents. (MS-ESS2-6) 

ESS3.D:  Global Climate Change 
  Human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from 

burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earth’s 
mean surface temperature (global warming). Reducing the level of 
climate change and reducing human vulnerability to whatever 
climate changes do occur depend on the understanding of climate 
science, engineering capabilities, and other kinds of knowledge, 
such as understanding of human behavior and on applying that 
knowledge wisely in decisions and activities. (MS-ESS3-5)

MS.Human Impacts 

Analyze and interpret data on natural hazards to forecast future catastrophic events and inform the development 
of technologies to mitigate their effects.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on how some natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions and 
severe weather, are preceded by phenomena that allow for reliable predictions, but others, such as earthquakes, occur suddenly and with no notice, and thus are 
not yet predictable. Examples of natural hazards can be taken from interior processes (such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions), surface processes (such as mass 
wasting and tsunamis), or severe weather events (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods). Examples of data can include the locations, magnitudes, and 
frequencies of the natural hazards. Examples of technologies can be global (such as satellite systems to monitor hurricanes or forest fires) or local (such as building 

basements in tornado-prone regions or reservoirs to mitigate droughts).]	

Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing a human impact on the 
environment.*  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of the design process include examining human environmental impacts, assessing the kinds of solutions 
that are feasible, and designing and evaluating solutions that could reduce that impact. Examples of human impacts can include water usage (such as the withdrawal 
of water from streams and aquifers or the construction of dams and levees), land usage (such as urban development, agriculture, or the removal of wetlands), and 
pollution (such as of the air, water, or land).]   
Construct an argument supported by evidence for how increases in human population and per-capita 
consumption of natural resources impact Earth’s systems.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of evidence include grade-appropriate 
databases on human populations and the rates of consumption of food and natural resources (such as freshwater, mineral, and energy). Examples of impacts can 
include changes to the appearance, composition, and structure of Earth’s systems as well as the rates at which they change. The consequences of increases in 
human populations and consumption of natural resources are described by science, but science does not make the decisions for the actions society takes.]

The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education:

 

Science and Engineering Practices 
Analyzing and Interpreting Data 
Analyzing data in 6–8 builds on K–5 experiences 
and progresses to extending quantitative analysis 
to investigations, distinguishing between 
correlation and causation, and basic statistical 
techniques of data and error analysis. 
  Analyze and interpret data to determine 

similarities and differences in findings. (MS-
ESS3-2)  

Constructing Explanations and Designing 
Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions 
in 6–8 builds on K–5 experiences and progresses to 
include constructing explanations and designing 
solutions supported by multiple sources of evidence 
consistent with scientific ideas, principles, and 
theories. 
  Apply scientific principles to design an object, 

tool, process or system. (MS-ESS3-3) 
Engaging in Argument from Evidence 
Engaging in argument from evidence in 6–8 builds 
on K–5 experiences and progresses to constructing 
a convincing argument that supports or refutes 
claims for either explanations or solutions about 
the natural and designed world(s). 
  Construct an oral and written argument 

supported by empirical evidence and scientific 
reasoning to support or refute an explanation 
or a model for a phenomenon or a solution to a 
problem. (MS-ESS3-4)

Crosscutting Concepts 

ESS3.B:  Natural Hazards 
  Mapping the history of natural hazards in a region, combined with an 

 

understanding of related geologic forces can help forecast the 
locations and likelihoods of future events. (MS-ESS3-2) 

ESS3.C:  Human Impacts on Earth Systems 
  Human activities have significantly altered the biosphere, sometimes 
damaging or destroying natural habitats and causing the extinction of 
other species. But changes to Earth’s environments can have different 
impacts (negative and positive) for different living things. (MS-ESS3-3) 
  Typically as human populations and per-capita consumption of natural 

resources increase, so do the negative impacts on Earth unless the 
activities and technologies involved are engineered otherwise. (MS-
ESS3-3),(MS-ESS3-4) 

 

Patterns 
  Graphs, charts, and images can be used to 

identify patterns in data. (MS-ESS3-2) 

Cause and Effect 
  Relationships can be classified as causal or 

correlational, and correlation does not necessarily 
imply causation. (MS-ESS3-3) 

  Cause and effect relationships may be used to 

predict phenomena in natural or designed 
systems. (MS-ESS3-4) 

------------------------------------------------ 
Connections to Engineering, Technology,	

and Applications of Science	
 
Influence of Science, Engineering, and 
Technology on Society and the Natural World  
  All human activity draws on natural resources and 

has both short and long-term consequences, 
positive as well as negative, for the health of 
people and the natural environment. (MS-ESS3-4) 

  The uses of technologies and any limitations on 

their use are driven by individual or societal 
needs, desires, and values; by the findings of 
scientific research; and by differences in such 
factors as climate, natural resources, and 
economic conditions. Thus technology use varies

High School Physical Sciences 

 
Students in high school continue to develop their understanding of the four core ideas in the 
physical sciences. These ideas include the most fundamental concepts from chemistry and 
physics, but are intended to leave room for expanded study in upper-level high school courses.  
The high school performance expectations in Physical Science build on the middle school ideas 
and skills and allow high school students to explain more in-depth phenomena central not only 
to the physical sciences, but to life and earth and space sciences as well. These performance 
expectations blend the core ideas with scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting 
concepts to support students in developing useable knowledge to explain ideas across the 
science disciplines. In the physical science performance expectations at the high school level, 
there is a focus on several scientific practices. These include developing and using models, 
planning and conducting investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, using mathematical 
and computational thinking, and constructing explanations; and to use these practices to 
demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. Students are also expected to demonstrate 
understanding of several engineering practices, including design and evaluation.   
 
The performance expectations in the topic Structure and Properties of Matter help students 
formulate an answer to the question, “How can one explain the structure and properties of 
matter?” Two sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance 
expectations: the structure and properties of matter, and nuclear processes. Students are 
expected to develop understanding of the substructure of atoms and provide more mechanistic 
explanations of the properties of substances. Students are able to use the periodic table as a 
tool to explain and predict the properties of elements. Phenomena involving nuclei are also 
important to understand, as they explain the formation and abundance of the elements, 
radioactivity, the release of energy from the sun and other stars, and the generation of nuclear 
power. The crosscutting concepts of patterns, energy and matter, and structure and function 
are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance 
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, 
planning and conducting investigations, and communicating scientific and technical information; 
and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.   
 
The performance expectations in the topic Chemical Reactions help students formulate an 
answer to the questions:  “How do substances combine or change (react) to make new 
substances? How does one characterize and explain these reactions and make predictions about 
them?” Chemical reactions, including rates of reactions and energy changes, can be understood 
by students at this level in terms of the collisions of molecules and the rearrangements of 
atoms. Using this expanded knowledge of chemical reactions, students are able to explain 
important biological and geophysical phenomena. Students are also able to apply an 
understanding of the process of optimization in engineering design to chemical reaction 
systems. The crosscutting concepts of patterns, energy and matter, and stability and change 
are called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In these performance 
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, 
using mathematical thinking, constructing explanations, and designing solutions; and to use 
these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.   
 
The Performance Expectations associated with the topic Forces and Interactions supports 
students’ understanding of ideas related to why some objects will keep moving, why objects fall 

November 2013©2013 Achieve, Inc. All rights reserved.65 of 102 

to the ground, and why some materials are attracted to each other while others are not. 
Students should be able to answer the question, “How can one explain and predict interactions 
between objects and within systems of objects?” The disciplinary core idea expressed in the 
Framework for PS2 is broken down into the sub ideas of Forces and Motion and Types of 
Interactions. The performance expectations in PS2 focus on students building understanding of 
forces and interactions and Newton’s Second Law. Students also develop understanding that 
the total momentum of a system of objects is conserved when there is no net force on the 
system. Students are able to use Newton’s Law of Gravitation and Coulomb’s Law to describe 
and predict the gravitational and electrostatic forces between objects. Students are able to 
apply scientific and engineering ideas to design, evaluate, and refine a device that minimizes 
the force on a macroscopic object during a collision. The crosscutting concepts of patterns, 
cause and effect, and systems and system models are called out as organizing concepts for 
these disciplinary core ideas. In the PS2 performance expectations, students are expected to 
demonstrate proficiency in planning and conducting investigations, analyzing data and using 
math to support claims, and applying scientific ideas to solve design problems; and to use these 
practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.   
 
The Performance Expectations associated with the topic Energy help students formulate an 
answer to the question, “How is energy transferred and conserved?” The disciplinary core idea 
expressed in the Framework for PS3 is broken down into four sub-core ideas:  Definitions of 
Energy, Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer, the Relationship between Energy and 
Forces, and Energy in Chemical Process and Everyday Life. Energy is understood as quantitative 
property of a system that depends on the motion and interactions of matter and radiation 
within that system, and the total change of energy in any system is always equal to the total 
energy transferred into or out of the system. Students develop an understanding that energy at 
both the macroscopic and the atomic scale can be accounted for as either motions of particles 
or energy associated with the configuration (relative positions) of particles.  In some cases, the 
energy associated with the configuration of particles can be thought of as stored in fields. 
Students also demonstrate their understanding of engineering principles when they design, 
build, and refine devices associated with the conversion of energy. The crosscutting concepts of 
cause and effect; systems and system models; energy and matter; and the influence of science, 
engineering, and technology on society and the natural world are further developed in the 
performance expectations associated with PS3. In these performance expectations, students are 
expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models, planning and carry out 
investigations, using computational thinking, and designing solutions; and to use these 
practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.    
 
The Performance Expectations associated with the topic Waves and Electromagnetic 
Radiation are critical to understand how many new technologies work. As such, this 
disciplinary core idea helps students answer the question, “How are waves used to transfer 
energy and send and store information?” The disciplinary core idea in PS4 is broken down into 
Wave Properties, Electromagnetic Radiation, and Information Technologies and 
Instrumentation. Students are able to apply understanding of how wave properties and the 
interactions of electromagnetic radiation with matter can transfer information across long 
distances, store information, and investigate nature on many scales. Models of electromagnetic 
radiation as either a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields or as particles are developed 
and used. Students understand that combining waves of different frequencies can make a wide 
variety of patterns and thereby encode and transmit information. Students also demonstrate 

November 2013©2013 Achieve, Inc. All rights reserved.66 of 102 

their understanding of engineering ideas by presenting information about how technological 
devices use the principles of wave behavior and wave interactions with matter to transmit and 
capture information and energy. The crosscutting concepts of cause and effect; systems and 
system models; stability and change; interdependence of science, engineering, and technology; 
and the influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are 
highlighted as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas. In the PS3 performance 
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in asking questions, using 
mathematical thinking, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating and 
communicating information; and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the 
core ideas.

High School Life Sciences 

 
Students in high school develop understanding of key concepts that help them make sense of 
life science. The ideas are building upon students’ science understanding of disciplinary core 
ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts from earlier grades. There 
are five life science topics in high school: 1) Structure and Function, 2) Inheritance and 
Variation of Traits, Matter and Energy in Organisms and Ecosystems, 4) Interdependent 
Relationships in Ecosystems, and 5) Natural Selection and Evolution. The performance 
expectations for high school life science blend core ideas with scientific and engineering 
practices and crosscutting concepts to support students in developing useable knowledge that 
can be applied across the science disciplines. While the performance expectations in high school 
life science couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional 
decisions should include use of many practices underlying the performance expectations. The 
performance expectations are based on the grade-band endpoints described in A Framework for 
K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012). 
 
The performance expectations in the topic Structure and Function help students formulate 
an answer to the question:  “How do the structures of organisms enable life’s functions?” High 
school students are able to investigate explanations for the structure and function of cells as the 
basic units of life, the hierarchical systems of organisms, and the role of specialized cells for 
maintenance and growth. Students demonstrate understanding of how systems of cells function 
together to support the life processes. Students demonstrate their understanding through 
critical reading, using models, and conducting investigations.  The crosscutting concepts of 
structure and function, matter and energy, and systems and system models in organisms are 
called out as organizing concepts.  
 
The performance expectations in the topic Inheritance and Variation of Traits help 
students in pursuing an answer to the question: “How are the characteristics from one 
generation related to the previous generation?” High school students demonstrate 
understanding of the relationship of DNA and chromosomes in the processes of cellular division 
that pass traits from one generation to the next. Students can determine why individuals of the 
same species vary in how they look, function, and behave. Students can develop conceptual 
models for the role of DNA in the unity of life on Earth and use statistical models to explain the 
importance of variation within populations for the survival and evolution of species. Ethical 
issues related to genetic modification of organisms and the nature of science can be described. 
Students can explain the mechanisms of genetic inheritance and describe the environmental 
and genetic causes of gene mutation and the alteration of gene expression. Crosscutting 
concepts of structure and function, patterns, and cause and effect developed in this topic help 
students to generalize understanding of inheritance of traits to other applications in science.  
 
The performance expectations in the topic Matter and Energy in Organisms and 
Ecosystems help students answer the questions: “How do organisms obtain and use energy 
they need to live and grow? How do matter and energy move through ecosystems?” High 
school students can construct explanations for the role of energy in the cycling of matter in 
organisms and ecosystems. They can apply mathematical concepts to develop evidence to 
support explanations of the interactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration and develop 

 

November 2013©2013 Achieve, Inc. All rights reserved.68 of 102 

models to communicate these explanations. They can relate the nature of science to how 
explanations may change in light of new evidence and the implications for our understanding of 
the tentative nature of science. Students understand organisms’ interactions with each other 
and their physical environment, how organisms obtain resources, change the environment, and 
how these changes affect both organisms and ecosystems. In addition, students can utilize the 
crosscutting concepts of matter and energy and Systems and system models to make sense of 
ecosystem dynamics.  
 
The performance expectations in the topic Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems 
help students answer the question, “How do organisms interact with the living and non-living 
environment to obtain matter and energy?” This topic builds on the other topics as high school 
students demonstrate an ability to investigate the role of biodiversity in ecosystems and the role 
of animal behavior on survival of individuals and species. Students have increased 
understanding of interactions among organisms and how those interactions influence the 
dynamics of ecosystems. Students can generate mathematical comparisons, conduct 
investigations, use models, and apply scientific reasoning to link evidence to explanations about 
interactions and changes within ecosystems.  
 
The performance expectations in the topic Natural Selection and Evolution help students 
answer the questions: “How can there be so many similarities among organisms yet so many 
different plants, animals, and microorganisms? How does biodiversity affect humans?” High 
school students can investigate patterns to find the relationship between the environment and 
natural selection. Students demonstrate understanding of the factors causing natural selection 
and the process of evolution of species over time. They demonstrate understanding of how 
multiple lines of evidence contribute to the strength of scientific theories of natural selection 
and evolution. Students can demonstrate an understanding of the processes that change the 
distribution of traits in a population over time and describe extensive scientific evidence ranging 
from the fossil record to genetic relationships among species that support the theory of 
biological evolution. Students can use models, apply statistics, analyze data, and produce 
scientific communications about evolution. Understanding of the crosscutting concepts of 
patterns, scale, structure and function, and cause and effect supports the development of a 
deeper understanding of this topic.

High School Earth and Space Sciences 

 
Students in high school develop understanding of a wide range of topics in Earth and 
space science (ESS) that build upon science concepts from middle school through more 
advanced content, practice, and crosscutting themes. There are five ESS standard topics 
in high school: Space Systems, History of Earth, Earth’s Systems, Weather and Climate, 
and Human Sustainability. The content of the performance expectations are based on 
current community-based geoscience literacy efforts such as the Earth Science Literacy 
Principles (Wysession et al., 2012), and is presented with a greater emphasis on an 
Earth Systems Science approach. There are strong connections to mathematical 
practices of analyzing and interpreting data. The performance expectations strongly 
reflect the many societally relevant aspects of ESS (resources, hazards, environmental 
impacts) with an emphasis on using engineering and technology concepts to design 
solutions to challenges facing human society.  While the performance expectations 
shown in high school ESS couple particular practices with specific disciplinary core ideas, 
instructional decisions should include use of many practices that lead to the performance 
expectations. 
 
The performance expectations in HS.Space Systems help students formulate answers 
to the questions: “What is the universe, and what goes on in stars?” and “What are the 
predictable patterns caused by Earth’s movement in the solar system?”  Four sub-ideas 
from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance expectations: ESS1.A, 
ESS1.B, PS3.D, and PS4.B.  High school students can examine the processes governing 
the formation, evolution, and workings of the solar system and universe. Some concepts 
studied are fundamental to science, such as understanding how the matter of our world 
formed during the Big Bang and within the cores of stars. Others concepts are practical, 
such as understanding how short-term changes in the behavior of our sun directly affect 
humans. Engineering and technology play a large role here in obtaining and analyzing 
the data that support the theories of the formation of the solar system and universe. 
The crosscutting concepts of patterns; scale, proportion, and quantity; energy and 
matter; and interdependence of science, engineering, and technology are called out as 
organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.  In the HS.Space Systems 
performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in 
developing and using models; using mathematical and computational thinking, 
constructing explanations; and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information; 
and to use these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. 
 
The performance expectations in HS.History of Earth help students formulate answers 
to the questions: “How do people reconstruct and date events in Earth’s planetary 
history?” and “Why do the continents move?”  Four sub-ideas from the NRC Framework 
are addressed in these performance expectations: ESS1.C, ESS2.A, ESS2.B, and PS1.C.  
Students can construct explanations for the scales of time over which Earth processes 
operate. An important aspect of Earth and space science involves making inferences 
about events in Earth’s history based on a data record that is increasingly incomplete 
that farther you go back in time. A mathematical analysis of radiometric dating is used 
to comprehend how absolute ages are obtained for the geologic record. A key to Earth’s 
history is the coevolution of the biosphere with Earth’s other systems, not only in the 
ways that climate and environmental changes have shaped the course of evolution but 

November 2013©2013 Achieve, Inc. All rights reserved.70 of 102 

also in how emerging life forms have been responsible for changing Earth. The 
crosscutting concepts of patterns and stability and change are called out as organizing 
concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.  In the HS.History of Earth performance 
expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using 
models, constructing explanations, and engaging in argument from evidence; and to use 
these practices to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. 
 
The performance expectations in HS.Earth’s Systems help students formulate answers 
to the questions: “How do the major Earth systems interact?” and “How do the 
properties and movements of water shape Earth’s surface and affect its systems?” Six 
sub-ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance expectations: 
ESS2.A, ESS2.B, ESS2.C, ESS2.D, ESS2.E, and PS4.A.  Students can develop models and 
explanations for the ways that feedbacks between different Earth systems control the 
appearance of Earth’s surface. Central to this is the tension between internal systems, 
which are largely responsible for creating land at Earth’s surface (e.g., volcanism and 
mountain building), and the sun-driven surface systems that tear down the land through 
weathering and erosion. Students understand the role that water plays in affecting 
weather.  Students understand chemical cycles such as the carbon cycle.  Students can 
examine the ways that human activities cause feedbacks that create changes to other 
systems. The crosscutting concepts of energy and matter; structure and function; 
stability and change; interdepence of science, engineering, and technology; and 
influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world are 
called out as organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.  In the HS.Earth’s 
Systems performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in 
developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and 
interpreting data, and engaging in argument from evidence; and to use these practices 
to demonstrate understanding of the core ideas. 
 
The performance expectations in HS.Weather and Climate help students formulate 
an answer to the question: “What regulates weather and climate?” Four sub-ideas from 
the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance expectations: ESS1.B, ESS2.A, 
ESS2.D, and ESS3.D. Students understand the system interactions that control weather 
and climate, with a major emphasis on the mechanisms and implications of climate 
change. Students can understand the analysis and interpretation of different kinds of 
geoscience data allow students to construct explanations for the many factors that drive 
climate change over a wide range of time scales. The crosscutting concepts of cause 
and effect and stability and change are called out as organizing concepts for these 
disciplinary core ideas.  In the HS.Weather and Climate performance expectations, 
students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in developing and using models and 
analyzing and interpreting data; and to use these practices to demonstrate 
understanding of the core ideas. 
 
The performance expectations in HS.Human Sustainability help students formulate 
answers to the questions: “How do humans depend on Earth’s resources?” and “How do 
people model and predict the effects of human activities on Earth’s climate?” Six sub-
ideas from the NRC Framework are addressed in these performance expectations: 
ESS2.D, ESS3.A, ESS3.B, ESS3.C, ESS3.D, and ETS1.B. Students understand the 
complex and significant interdependencies between humans and the rest of Earth’s 

 

November 2013©2013 Achieve, Inc. All rights reserved.71 of 102 

systems through the impacts of natural hazards, our dependencies on natural resources, 
and the environmental impacts of human activities. The crosscutting concepts of cause 
and effect; systems and system models; stability and change; and influence of 
engineering, technology and science on society and the natural world are called out as 
organizing concepts for these disciplinary core ideas.  In the HS.Human Sustainability 
performance expectations, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in using 
mathematics and computational thinking, constructing explanations and designing 
solutions, and engaging in argument from evidence; and to use these practices to 
demonstrate understanding of the core ideas.

High School Engineering Design 

At the high school level students are expected to engage with major global issues at the 
interface of science, technology, society and the environment, and to bring to bear the 
kinds of analytical and strategic thinking that prior training and increased maturity make 
possible.  As in prior levels, these capabilities can be thought of in three stages—defining 
the problem, developing possible solutions, and improving designs. 

Defining the problem at the high school level requires both qualitative and quantitative 
analysis.  For example, the need to provide food and fresh water for future generations 
comes into sharp focus when considering the speed at which world population is growing, 
and conditions in countries that have experienced famine.  While high school students are 
not expected to solve these challenges, they are expected to begin thinking about them as 
problems that can be addressed, at least in part, through engineering.  

Developing possible solutions for major global problems begins by breaking them 
down into smaller problems that can be tackled with engineering methods. To evaluate 
potential solutions students are expected to not only consider a wide range of criteria, but 
to also recognize that criteria need to be prioritized. For example, public safety or 
environmental protection may be more important than cost or even functionality. 
Decisions on priorities can then guide tradeoff choices. 

Improving designs at the high school level may involve sophisticated methods, such as 
using computer simulations to model proposed solutions.  Students are expected to use 
such methods to take into account a range of criteria and constraints, to try and anticipate 
possible societal and environmental impacts, and to test the validity of their simulations by 
comparison to the real world. 

Connections with other science disciplines help high school students develop these 
capabilities in various contexts.  For example, in the life sciences students are expected to 
design, evaluate, and refine a solution for reducing human impact on the environment 
(HS-LS2-7) and to create or revise a simulation to test solutions for mitigating adverse 
impacts of human activity on biodiversity (HS-LS4-6). In the physical sciences students 
solve problems by applying their engineering capabilities along with their knowledge of 
conditions for chemical reactions (HS-PS1-6), forces during collisions (HS-PS2-3), and 
conversion of energy from one form to another (HS-PS3-3). In the Earth and space 
sciences students apply their engineering capabilities to reduce human impacts on Earth 
systems, and improve social and environmental cost-benefit ratios (HS-ESS3-2, HS-ESS3-
4). 

By the end of 12th grade students are expected to achieve all four HS-ETS1 performance 
expectations (HS-ETS1-1, HS-ETS1-2, HS-ETS1-3, and HS-ETS1-4) related to a single 
problem in order to understand the interrelated processes of engineering design.  These 
include analyzing major global challenges, quantifying criteria and constraints for 
solutions; breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable problems, 
evaluating alternative solutions based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs, and using a 
computer simulation to model the impact of proposed solutions.  While the performance 
expectations shown in High School Engineering Design couple particular practices with 
specific disciplinary core ideas, instructional decisions should include use of many practices 
that lead to the performance expectations.

HS.Structure and Properties of Matter 
Students who demonstrate understanding can: 
HS-PS1-1.  Use the periodic table as a model to predict the relative properties of elements based on the patterns of 

electrons in the outermost energy level of atoms.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of properties that could be predicted from patterns 
could include reactivity of metals, types of bonds formed, numbers of bonds formed, and reactions with oxygen.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited 
to main group elements. Assessment does not include quantitative understanding of ionization energy beyond relative trends.] 

HS-PS1-3.  Plan and conduct an investigation to gather evidence to compare the structure of substances at the bulk scale 
to infer the strength of electrical forces between particles.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on understanding the strengths of 
forces between particles, not on naming specific intermolecular forces (such as dipole-dipole). Examples of particles could include ions, atoms, molecules, and 
networked materials (such as graphite). Examples of bulk properties of substances could include the melting point and boiling point, vapor pressure, and surface 
tension.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include Raoult’s law calculations of vapor pressure.] 

HS-PS1-8.  Develop models to illustrate the changes in the composition of the nucleus of the atom and the energy 

released during the processes of fission, fusion, and radioactive decay.   [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on simple 
qualitative models, such as pictures or diagrams, and on the scale of energy released in nuclear processes relative to other kinds of transformations.] 
[Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include quantitative calculation of energy released. Assessment is limited to alpha, beta, and gamma radioactive 
decays.] 

HS-PS2-6.  Communicate scientific and technical information about why the molecular-level structure is important in the 
functioning of designed materials.*  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the attractive and repulsive forces that determine the functioning 
of the material. Examples could include why electrically conductive materials are often made of metal, flexible but durable materials are made up of long chained 
molecules, and pharmaceuticals are designed to interact with specific receptors.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to provided molecular structures 
of specific designed materials.]   

The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education:

Science and Engineering Practices

evidence for and test conceptual, mathematical, physical, and 
empirical models. 
  Plan and conduct an investigation individually and 

collaboratively to produce data to serve as the basis for 
evidence, and in the design: decide on types, how much, and 
accuracy of data needed to produce reliable measurements 
and consider limitations on the precision of the data (e.g., 
number of trials, cost, risk, time), and refine the design 
accordingly. (HS-PS1-3)

builds on K–8 and progresses to evaluating the validity and 
reliability of the claims, methods, and designs.

the process of development and the design and performance 
of a proposed process or system) in multiple formats 
(including orally, graphically, textually, and mathematically). 
(HS-PS2-6) 

Disciplinary Core Ideas

those with similar chemical properties in columns. The 
repeating patterns of this table reflect patterns of outer 
electron states. (HS-PS1-1)

  Attraction and repulsion between electric charges at the 

 

atomic scale explain the structure, properties, and 
transformations of matter, as well as the contact forces 
between material objects. (secondary to HS-PS1-
1),(secondary to HS-PS1-3),(HS-PS2-6) 

 

	

Crosscutting Concepts 

Patterns 
  Different patterns may be observed at 
each of the scales at which a system is 
studied and can provide evidence for 
causality in explanations of phenomena. 
(HS-PS1-1),(HS-PS1-3) 

Energy and Matter  
  In nuclear processes, atoms are not 

conserved, but the total number of protons 
plus neutrons is conserved. (HS-PS1-8) 

Structure and Function

Students who demonstrate understanding can: 

HS.Chemical Reactions 

HS-PS1-2.  Construct and revise an explanation for the outcome of a simple chemical reaction based on the outermost 

electron states of atoms, trends in the periodic table, and knowledge of the patterns of chemical properties.  
[Clarification Statement:  Examples of chemical reactions could include the reaction of sodium and chlorine, of carbon and oxygen, or of carbon and hydrogen.] 
[Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to chemical reactions involving main group elements and combustion reactions.]  

HS-PS1-4.  Develop a model to illustrate that the release or absorption of energy from a chemical reaction system 

depends upon the changes in total bond energy.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the idea that a chemical reaction is a system 
that affects the energy change. Examples of models could include molecular-level drawings and diagrams of reactions, graphs showing the relative energies of 
reactants and products, and representations showing energy is conserved.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include calculating the total bond 
energy changes during a chemical reaction from the bond energies of reactants and products.] 

HS-PS1-5.  Apply scientific principles and evidence to provide an explanation about the effects of changing the 

temperature or concentration of the reacting particles on the rate at which a reaction occurs.  [Clarification 
Statement:  Emphasis is on student reasoning that focuses on the number and energy of collisions between molecules.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is 
limited to simple reactions in which there are only two reactants; evidence from temperature, concentration, and rate data; and qualitative relationships 
between rate and temperature.] 

HS-PS1-6.  Refine the design of a chemical system by specifying a change in conditions that would produce increased 
amounts of products at equilibrium.*  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the application of Le Chatelier’s Principle and on refining 
designs of chemical reaction systems, including descriptions of the connection between changes made at the macroscopic level and what happens at the 
molecular level. Examples of designs could include different ways to increase product formation including adding reactants or removing products.] [Assessment 
Boundary:  Assessment is limited to specifying the change in only one variable at a time. Assessment does not include calculating equilibrium constants and 
concentrations.]  

HS-PS1-7.  Use mathematical representations to support the claim that atoms, and therefore mass, are conserved 

during a chemical reaction.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on using mathematical ideas to communicate the proportional relationships 
between masses of atoms in the reactants and the products, and the translation of these relationships to the macroscopic scale using the mole as the 
conversion from the atomic to the macroscopic scale. Emphasis is on assessing students’ use of mathematical thinking and not on memorization and rote 
application of problem-solving techniques.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include complex chemical reactions.] 

The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education:

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Developing and Using Models 
Modeling in 9–12 builds on K–8 and progresses to using, 
synthesizing, and developing models to predict and show 
relationships among variables between systems and their 
components in the natural and designed worlds.   
  Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the 

relationships between systems or between components of a 
system. (HS-PS1-4) 

Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking 
Mathematical and computational thinking at the 9–12 level builds 
on K–8 and progresses to using algebraic thinking and analysis, 
a range of linear and nonlinear functions including trigonometric 
functions, exponentials and logarithms, and computational tools 
for statistical analysis to analyze, represent, and model data. 
Simple computational simulations are created and used based on 
mathematical models of basic assumptions. 
  Use mathematical representations of phenomena to support 

claims. (HS-PS1-7) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 9–12 builds 
on K–8 experiences and progresses to explanations and designs 
that are supported by multiple and independent student-
generated sources of evidence consistent with scientific ideas, 
principles, and theories.  
  Apply scientific principles and evidence to provide an 

explanation of phenomena and solve design problems, taking 
into account possible unanticipated effects. (HS-PS1-5) 
  Construct and revise an explanation based on valid and 

reliable evidence obtained from a variety of sources (including 
students’ own investigations, models, theories, simulations, 
peer review) and the assumption that theories and laws that 
describe the natural world operate today as they did in the 
past and will continue to do so in the future. (HS-PS1-2) 

  Refine a solution to a complex real-world problem, based on 
scientific knowledge, student-generated sources of evidence, 
prioritized criteria, and tradeoff considerations. (HS-PS1-6) 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 
PS1.A:  Structure and Properties of Matter 
  The periodic table orders elements horizontally by the 

number of protons in the atom’s nucleus and places 
those with similar chemical properties in columns. The 
repeating patterns of this table reflect patterns of outer 
electron states. (HS-PS1-2) (Note: This Disciplinary Core 
Idea is also addressed by HS-PS1-1.) 

  A stable molecule has less energy than the same set of 
atoms separated; one must provide at least this energy 
in order to take the molecule apart. (HS-PS1-4) 

PS1.B:  Chemical Reactions 
  Chemical processes, their rates, and whether or not 

energy is stored or released can be understood in terms 
of the collisions of molecules and the rearrangements of 
atoms into new molecules, with consequent changes in 
the sum of all bond energies in the set of molecules 
that are matched by changes in kinetic energy. (HS-
PS1-4),(HS-PS1-5) 

  In many situations, a dynamic and condition-dependent 

balance between a reaction and the reverse reaction 
determines the numbers of all types of molecules 
present. (HS-PS1-6) 

  The fact that atoms are conserved, together with 

knowledge of the chemical properties of the elements 
involved, can be used to describe and predict chemical 
reactions. (HS-PS1-2),(HS-PS1-7)  

ETS1.C: Optimizing the Design Solution 
  Criteria may need to be broken down into simpler ones 

that can be approached systematically, and decisions 
about the priority of certain criteria over others (trade-
offs) may be needed. (secondary to HS-PS1-6) 

Crosscutting Concepts 

Patterns 
  Different patterns may be observed at 
each of the scales at which a system is 
studied and can provide evidence for 
causality in explanations of phenomena. 
(HS-PS1-2),(HS-PS1-5) 

Energy and Matter  
  The total amount of energy and matter in 
closed systems is conserved. (HS-PS1-7) 

  Changes of energy and matter in a system 

can be described in terms of energy and 
matter flows into, out of, and within that 
system. (HS-PS1-4) 
Stability and Change  
  Much of science deals with constructing 
explanations of how things change and 
how they remain stable. (HS-PS1-6) 

--------------------------------------------- 

Connections to Nature of Science 

 
Scientific Knowledge Assumes an Order 
and Consistency in Natural Systems 
  Science assumes the universe is a vast 

single system in which basic laws are 
consistent. (HS-PS1-7)

HS-PS2-1.  Analyze data to support the claim that Newton’s second law of motion describes the mathematical relationship 
among the net force on a macroscopic object, its mass, and its acceleration.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of data could 
include tables or graphs of position or velocity as a function of time for objects subject to a net unbalanced force, such as a falling object, an object rolling down a 
ramp, or a moving object being pulled by a constant force.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to one-dimensional motion and to macroscopic objects 
moving at non-relativistic speeds.] 

HS-PS2-2.  Use mathematical representations to support the claim that the total momentum of a system of objects is 

conserved when there is no net force on the system.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the quantitative conservation of momentum 
in interactions and the qualitative meaning of this principle.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to systems of two macroscopic bodies moving in one 
dimension.]

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

Planning and Carrying Out Investigations 
Planning and carrying out investigations to answer questions or test 
solutions to problems in 9–12 builds on K–8 experiences and 
progresses to include investigations that provide evidence for and 
test conceptual, mathematical, physical and empirical models. 
  Plan and conduct an investigation individually and collaboratively 

to produce data to serve as the basis for evidence, and in the 
design: decide on types, how much, and accuracy of data 
needed to produce reliable measurements and consider 
limitations on the precision of the data (e.g., number of trials, 
cost, risk, time), and refine the design accordingly. (HS-PS2-5) 

Analyzing and Interpreting Data 
Analyzing data in 9–12 builds on K–8 and progresses to introducing 
more detailed statistical analysis, the comparison of data sets for 
consistency, and the use of models to generate and analyze data. 
  Analyze data using tools, technologies, and/or models (e.g., 

computational, mathematical) in order to make valid and reliable 
scientific claims or determine an optimal design solution. (HS-
PS2-1) 

Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking 
Mathematical and computational thinking at the 9–12 level builds on 
K–8 and progresses to using algebraic thinking and analysis, a range 
of linear and nonlinear functions including trigonometric functions, 
exponentials and logarithms, and computational tools for statistical 
analysis to analyze, represent, and model data. Simple computational 
simulations are created and used based on mathematical models of 
basic assumptions. 
  Use mathematical representations of phenomena to describe 

explanations. (HS-PS2-2),(HS-PS2-4) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 9–12 builds on 
K–8 experiences and progresses to explanations and designs that are 
supported by multiple and independent student-generated sources of 
evidence consistent with scientific ideas, principles, and theories.  
  Apply scientific ideas to solve a design problem, taking into 

account possible unanticipated effects. (HS-PS2-3)

Connections to Nature of Science  

 
Science Models, Laws, Mechanisms, and Theories Explain 
Natural Phenomena 
  Theories and laws provide explanations in science. (HS-PS2-

1),(HS-PS2-4) 

  Laws are statements or descriptions of the relationships among 

observable phenomena. (HS-PS2-1),(HS-PS2-4) 

Patterns 
  Different patterns may be observed at 
each of the scales at which a system is 
studied and can provide evidence for 
causality in explanations of phenomena. 
(HS-PS2-4) 

Cause and Effect 
  Empirical evidence is required to 
differentiate between cause and 
correlation and make claims about 
specific causes and effects. (HS-PS2-
1),(HS-PS2-5) 

  Systems can be designed to cause a 

desired effect. (HS-PS2-3) 

Systems and System Models 
  When investigating or describing a 
system, the boundaries and initial 
conditions of the system need to be 
defined. (HS-PS2-2) 
 

PS2.A:  Forces and Motion 
  Newton’s second law accurately predicts changes in the 

motion of macroscopic objects. (HS-PS2-1) 

  Momentum is defined for a particular frame of reference; 
it is the mass times the velocity of the object. (HS-PS2-2) 
  If a system interacts with objects outside itself, the total 

momentum of the system can change; however, any 
such change is balanced by changes in the momentum of 
objects outside the system. (HS-PS2-2),(HS-PS2-3) 

PS2.B:  Types of Interactions 
  Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Coulomb’s law 
provide the mathematical models to describe and predict 
the effects of gravitational and electrostatic forces 
between distant objects. (HS-PS2-4) 

  Forces at a distance are explained by fields (gravitational, 

electric, and magnetic) permeating space that can 
transfer energy through space. Magnets or electric 
currents cause magnetic fields; electric charges or 
changing magnetic fields cause electric fields. (HS-PS2-
4),(HS-PS2-5) 

PS3.A:  Definitions of Energy 
  “Electrical energy” may mean energy stored in a battery 
or energy transmitted by electric currents. (secondary to 
HS-PS2-5) 

ETS1.A:  Defining and Delimiting Engineering 
Problems 
  Criteria and constraints also include satisfying any 

requirements set by society, such as taking issues of risk 
mitigation into account, and they should be quantified to 
the extent possible and stated in such a way that one can 
tell if a given design meets them. (secondary to HS-PS2-
3) 

ETS1.C:  Optimizing the Design Solution 
  Criteria may need to be broken down into simpler ones 

that can be approached systematically, and decisions 
about the priority of certain criteria over others (trade-
offs) may be needed. (secondary to HS-PS2-3)

Students who demonstrate understanding can:

algebraic expressions or computations; to systems of two or three components; and to thermal energy, kinetic energy, and/or the energies in gravitational, 
magnetic, or electric fields.]

PS3.A:  Definitions of Energy 
  Energy is a quantitative property of a system that depends on 
the motion and interactions of matter and radiation within that 
system. That there is a single quantity called energy is due to 
the fact that a system’s total energy is conserved, even as, 
within the system, energy is continually transferred from one 
object to another and between its various possible forms. (HS-
PS3-1),(HS-PS3-2) 

  At the macroscopic scale, energy manifests itself in multiple 

ways, such as in motion, sound, light, and thermal energy. (HS-
PS3-2) (HS-PS3-3) 

  These relationships are better understood at the microscopic 

scale, at which all of the different manifestations of energy can 
be modeled as a combination of energy associated with the 
motion of particles and energy associated with the configuration 
(relative position of the particles). In some cases the relative 
position energy can be thought of as stored in fields (which 
mediate interactions between particles). This last concept 
includes radiation, a phenomenon in which energy stored in 
fields moves across space. (HS-PS3-2) 

PS3.B:  Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer 
  Conservation of energy means that the total change of energy in 

any system is always equal to the total energy transferred into 
or out of the system. (HS-PS3-1) 

  Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transported 

from one place to another and transferred between systems. 
(HS-PS3-1),(HS-PS3-4) 

  Mathematical expressions, which quantify how the stored energy 

in a system depends on its configuration (e.g. relative positions 
of charged particles, compression of a spring) and how kinetic 
energy depends on mass and speed, allow the concept of 
conservation of energy to be used to predict and describe 
system behavior. (HS-PS3-1) 

  The availability of energy limits what can occur in any system. 

(HS-PS3-1) 

  Uncontrolled systems always evolve toward more stable states—

that is, toward more uniform energy distribution (e.g., water 
flows downhill, objects hotter than their surrounding 
environment cool down). (HS-PS3-4) 

PS3.C:  Relationship Between Energy and Forces 
  When two objects interacting through a field change relative 

position, the energy stored in the field is changed. (HS-PS3-5) 

Cause and Effect 
  Cause and effect relationships can be 

suggested and predicted for complex natural 
and human designed systems by examining 
what is known about smaller scale mechanisms 
within the system. (HS-PS3-5) 

Systems and System Models 
  When investigating or describing a system, the 
boundaries and initial conditions of the system 
need to be defined and their inputs and 
outputs analyzed and described using models. 
(HS-PS3-4) 

  Models can be used to predict the behavior of a 

system, but these predictions have limited 
precision and reliability due to the assumptions 
and approximations inherent in models. (HS-
PS3-1) 

Energy and Matter 
  Changes of energy and matter in a system can 

be described in terms of energy and matter 
flows into, out of, and within that system. (HS-
PS3-3) 

  Energy cannot be created or destroyed—only 
moves between one place and another place, 
between objects and/or fields, or between 
systems. (HS-PS3-2)

HS-PS4-3.  Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning behind the idea that electromagnetic radiation can be described 

either by a wave model or a particle model, and that for some situations one model is more useful than the other.  
[Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on how the experimental evidence supports the claim and how a theory is generally modified in light of new evidence. Examples

theory.]

electromagnetic radiation have when absorbed by matter.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the idea that photons associated with 
different frequencies of light have different energies, and the damage to living tissue from electromagnetic radiation depends on the energy of the radiation. Examples 
of published materials could include trade books, magazines, web resources, videos, and other passages that may reflect bias.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is 
limited to qualitative descriptions.]

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

Asking Questions and Defining Problems 
Asking questions and defining problems in grades 9–12 builds from 
grades K–8 experiences and progresses to formulating, refining, and 
evaluating empirically testable questions and design problems using 
models and simulations. 
  Evaluate questions that challenge the premise(s) of an argument, 
the interpretation of a data set, or the suitability of a design. (HS-
PS4-2) 

Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking 
Mathematical and computational thinking at the 9-12 level builds on K-8 
and progresses to using algebraic thinking and analysis, a range of 
linear and nonlinear functions including trigonometric functions, 
exponentials and logarithms, and computational tools for statistical 
analysis to analyze, represent, and model data. Simple computational 
simulations are created and used based on mathematical models of 
basic assumptions. 
  Use mathematical representations of phenomena or design solutions 

to describe and/or support claims and/or explanations. (HS-PS4-1) 

Engaging in Argument from Evidence 
Engaging in argument from evidence in 9–12 builds on K–8 experiences 
and progresses to using appropriate and sufficient evidence and 
scientific reasoning to defend and critique claims and explanations 
about natural and designed worlds. Arguments may also come from 
current scientific or historical episodes in science. 
  Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning behind currently 
accepted explanations or solutions to determine the merits of 
arguments. (HS-PS4-3) 

Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information 
Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information in 9–12 builds on 
K–8 and progresses to evaluating the validity and reliability of the 
claims, methods, and designs. 
  Evaluate the validity and reliability of multiple claims that appear in 

scientific and technical texts or media reports, verifying the data 
when possible. (HS-PS4-4) 

  Communicate technical information or ideas (e.g. about phenomena 

and/or the process of development and the design and 
performance of a proposed process or system) in multiple formats 
(including orally, graphically, textually, and mathematically). (HS-
PS4-5) 
 

----------------------------------------------------- 

Connections to Nature of Science  

 

Science Models, Laws, Mechanisms, and Theories Explain 
Natural Phenomena 
  A scientific theory is a substantiated explanation of some aspect of 

the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been 
repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment and the 
science community validates each theory before it is accepted. If 
new evidence is discovered that the theory does not accommodate, 

PS3.D:   Energy in Chemical Processes 
  Solar cells are human-made devices that likewise capture 

the sun’s energy and produce electrical energy. 
(secondary to HS-PS4-5) 
PS4.A:  Wave Properties 
  The wavelength and frequency of a wave are related to 
one another by the speed of travel of the wave, which 
depends on the type of wave and the medium through 
which it is passing. (HS-PS4-1) 

  Information can be digitized (e.g., a picture stored as the 
values of an array of pixels); in this form, it can be stored 
reliably in computer memory and sent over long 
distances as a series of wave pulses. (HS-PS4-2),(HS-
PS4-5) 

  [From the 3–5 grade band endpoints] Waves can add or 

cancel one another as they cross, depending on their 
relative phase (i.e., relative position of peaks and troughs 
of the waves), but they emerge unaffected by each 
other. (Boundary: The discussion at this grade level is 
qualitative only; it can be based on the fact that two 
different sounds can pass a location in different directions 
without getting mixed up.) (HS-PS4-3) 

PS4.B:  Electromagnetic Radiation   
  Electromagnetic radiation (e.g., radio, microwaves, light) 

can be modeled as a wave of changing electric and 
magnetic fields or as particles called photons. The wave 
model is useful for explaining many features of 
electromagnetic radiation, and the particle model 
explains other features. (HS-PS4-3) 

  When light or longer wavelength electromagnetic 

radiation is absorbed in matter, it is generally converted 
into thermal energy (heat). Shorter wavelength 
electromagnetic radiation (ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma 
rays) can ionize atoms and cause damage to living cells. 
(HS-PS4-4) 

  Photoelectric materials emit electrons when they absorb 

light of a high-enough frequency. (HS-PS4-5) 

PS4.C:  Information Technologies and 
Instrumentation 
  Multiple technologies based on the understanding of 
waves and their interactions with matter are part of 
everyday experiences in the modern world (e.g., medical 
imaging, communications, scanners) and in scientific 
research. They are essential tools for producing, 
transmitting, and capturing signals and for storing and 
interpreting the information contained in them. (HS-PS4-
5) 

	

Cause and Effect 
  Empirical evidence is required to 
differentiate between cause and 
correlation and make claims about 
specific causes and effects. (HS-PS4-1) 

  Cause and effect relationships can be 
suggested and predicted for complex 
natural and human designed systems by 
examining what is known about smaller 
scale mechanisms within the system. 
(HS-PS4-4) 

  Systems can be designed to cause a 

desired effect. (HS-PS4-5) 

Systems and System Models 
  Models (e.g., physical, mathematical, 

computer models) can be used to 
simulate systems and interactions—
including energy, matter, and 
information flows—within and between 
systems at different scales. (HS-PS4-3) 

Stability and Change 
  Systems can be designed for greater or 

lesser stability. (HS-PS4-2) 

 
--------------------------------------------- 
Connections to Engineering, Technology,

and Applications of Science 

 
Interdependence of Science, 
Engineering, and Technology 
  Science and engineering complement 

each other in the cycle known as 
research and development (R&D). (HS-
PS4-5) 

Influence of Engineering, Technology, 
and Science on Society and the Natural 
World 
  Modern civilization depends on major 
technological systems. (HS-PS4-2),(HS-
PS4-5) 

  Engineers continuously modify these 

technological systems by applying 
scientific knowledge and engineering 
design practices to increase benefits 
while decreasing costs and risks. (HS-

The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education:

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

LS1.A:  Structure and Function 
  Systems of specialized cells within organisms help them 

perform the essential functions of life. (HS-LS1-1) 

   All cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA 

molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA that contain the 
instructions that code for the formation of proteins, which carry 
out most of the work of cells. (HS-LS1-1) (Note: This 
Disciplinary Core Idea is also addressed by HS-LS3-1.)  

  Multicellular organisms have a hierarchical structural 

organization, in which any one system is made up of numerous 
parts and is itself a component of the next level. (HS-LS1-2) 

  Feedback mechanisms maintain a living system’s internal 

conditions within certain limits and mediate behaviors, allowing 
it to remain alive and functional even as external conditions 
change within some range. Feedback mechanisms can 
encourage (through positive feedback) or discourage (negative 
feedback) what is going on inside the living system. (HS-LS1-3) 

Systems and System Models 
  Models (e.g., physical, mathematical, 

computer models) can be used to 
simulate systems and interactions—
including energy, matter, and 
information flows—within and between 
systems at different scales. (HS-LS1-2) 

Structure and Function  
  Investigating or designing new systems 

or structures requires a detailed 
examination of the properties of 
different materials, the structures of 
different components, and connections 
of components to reveal its function 
and/or solve a problem. (HS-LS1-1) 

Stability and Change 
  Feedback (negative or positive) can 
stabilize or destabilize a system. (HS-
LS1-3) 
 

Developing and Using Models 
Modeling in 9–12 builds on K–8 experiences and progresses to 
using, synthesizing, and developing models to predict and show 
relationships among variables between systems and their 
components in the natural and designed world.   
  Develop and use a model based on evidence to illustrate the 
relationships between systems or between components of a 
system. (HS-LS1-2) 

Planning and Carrying Out Investigations 
Planning and carrying out in 9-12 builds on K-8 experiences and 
progresses to include investigations that provide evidence for and 
test conceptual, mathematical, physical, and empirical models.  
  Plan and conduct an investigation individually and 

collaboratively to produce data to serve as the basis for 
evidence, and in the design: decide on types, how much, and 
accuracy of data needed to produce reliable measurements 
and consider limitations on the precision of the data (e.g., 
number of trials, cost, risk, time), and refine the design 
accordingly. (HS-LS1-3) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 9–12 builds 
on K–8 experiences and progresses to explanations and designs 
that are supported by multiple and independent student-
generated sources of evidence consistent with scientific ideas, 
principles, and theories. 
  Construct an explanation based on valid and reliable evidence 

obtained from a variety of sources (including students’ own 
investigations, models, theories, simulations, peer review) and 
the assumption that theories and laws that describe the 
natural world operate today as they did in the past and will 
continue to do so in the future. (HS-LS1-1)   

	

-------------------------------------------------------- 

Connections to Nature of Science  

 

Scientific Investigations Use a Variety of Methods 
  Scientific inquiry is characterized by a common set of values 

that include: logical thinking, precision, open-mindedness, 
objectivity, skepticism, replicability of results, and honest and 
ethical reporting of findings. (HS-LS1-3)

Conduct short as well as more sustained research projects to answer a question (including a self-generated question) or solve a problem; narrow or broaden 
the inquiry when appropriate; synthesize multiple sources on the subject, demonstrating understanding of the subject under investigation. (HS-LS1-3) 
Gather relevant information from multiple authoritative print and digital sources, using advanced searches effectively; assess the strengths and limitations of 
each source in terms of the specific task, purpose, and audience; integrate information into the text selectively to maintain the flow of ideas, avoiding

the details of the specific chemical reactions or identification of macromolecules.] 

HS-LS1-7.  Use a model to illustrate that cellular respiration is a chemical process whereby the bonds of food molecules and 
oxygen molecules are broken and the bonds in new compounds are formed resulting in a net transfer of energy.  
[Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the conceptual understanding of the inputs and outputs of the process of cellular respiration.] [Assessment Boundary:  
Assessment should not include identification of the steps or specific processes involved in cellular respiration.] 

HS-LS2-3.  Construct and revise an explanation based on evidence for the cycling of matter and flow of energy in aerobic and 

anaerobic conditions.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on conceptual understanding of the role of aerobic and anaerobic respiration in different

HS-LS2-4.  Use mathematical representations to support claims for the cycling of matter and flow of energy among 

organisms in an ecosystem.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on using a mathematical model of stored energy in biomass to describe the transfer of 
energy from one trophic level to another and that matter and energy are conserved as matter cycles and energy flows through ecosystems. Emphasis is on atoms and 
molecules such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen being conserved as they move through an ecosystem.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to 
proportional reasoning to describe the cycling of matter and flow of energy.]

trigonometric functions, exponentials and logarithms, and

LS2-3)   

-------------------------------------------------------- 

Connections to Nature of Science  

 
Scientific Knowledge is Open to Revision in Light of New 
Evidence 
  Most scientific knowledge is quite durable, but is, in principle, 

subject to change based on new evidence and/or 
reinterpretation of existing evidence. (HS-LS2-3) 
 

Systems and System Models 
  Models (e.g., physical, mathematical, 

computer models) can be used to 
simulate systems and interactions—
including energy, matter, and 
information flows—within and between 
systems at different scales. (HS-LS2-5) 

Energy and Matter  
  Changes of energy and matter in a 
system can be described in terms of 
energy and matter flows into, out of, 
and within that system. (HS-LS1-5), 
(HS-LS1-6) 

  Energy cannot be created or 

destroyed—it only moves between one 
place and another place, between 
objects and/or fields, or between 
systems.(HS-LS1-7),(HS-LS2-4) 

  Energy drives the cycling of matter 

within and between systems. (HS-LS2-
3) 
 

LS1.C:  Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in 
Organisms  
  The process of photosynthesis converts light energy to stored 
chemical energy by converting carbon dioxide plus water into 
sugars plus released oxygen. (HS-LS1-5) 

  The sugar molecules thus formed contain carbon, hydrogen, 
and oxygen: their hydrocarbon backbones are used to make 
amino acids and other carbon-based molecules that can be 
assembled into larger molecules (such as proteins or DNA), 
used for example to form new cells. (HS-LS1-6) 

  As matter and energy flow through different organizational 

levels of living systems, chemical elements are recombined in 
different ways to form different products. (HS-LS1-6),(HS-LS1-
7) 

  As a result of these chemical reactions, energy is transferred 
from one system of interacting molecules to another. Cellular 
respiration is a chemical process in which the bonds of food 
molecules and oxygen molecules are broken and new 
compounds are formed that can transport energy to muscles. 
Cellular respiration also releases the energy needed to maintain 
body temperature despite ongoing energy transfer to the 
surrounding environment.(HS-LS1-7) 

LS2.B:  Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems  
  Photosynthesis and cellular respiration (including anaerobic 

processes) provide most of the energy for life processes. (HS-
LS2-3) 

  Plants or algae form the lowest level of the food web. At each 
link upward in a food web, only a small fraction of the matter 
consumed at the lower level is transferred upward, to produce 
growth and release energy in cellular respiration at the higher 
level. Given this inefficiency, there are generally fewer 
organisms at higher levels of a food web. Some matter reacts 
to release energy for life functions, some matter is stored in 
newly made structures, and much is discarded. The chemical 
elements that make up the molecules of organisms pass 
through food webs and into and out of the atmosphere and 
soil, and they are combined and recombined in different ways. 
At each link in an ecosystem, matter and energy are 
conserved. (HS-LS2-4) 

  Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are important 

components of the carbon cycle, in which carbon is exchanged 
among the biosphere, atmosphere, oceans, and geosphere 
through chemical, physical, geological, and biological 
processes. (HS-LS2-5) 

PS3.D:   Energy in Chemical Processes 
  The main way that solar energy is captured and stored on 
Earth is through the complex chemical process known as

HS.Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems 

HS-LS2-1.  Use mathematical and/or computational representations to support explanations of factors that affect 

carrying capacity of ecosystems at different scales.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on quantitative analysis and comparison of the 
relationships among interdependent factors including boundaries, resources, climate and competition. Examples of mathematical comparisons could include 
graphs, charts, histograms, and population changes gathered from simulations or historical data sets.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include 
deriving mathematical equations to make comparisons.]

HS-LS2-6.  Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively 
consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions, but changing conditions may result in a new 
ecosystem.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of changes in ecosystem conditions could include modest biological or physical changes, such as moderate

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking 
Mathematical and computational thinking in 9-12 builds on K-8 
experiences and progresses to using algebraic thinking and 
analysis, a range of linear and nonlinear functions including 
trigonometric functions, exponentials and logarithms, and 
computational tools for statistical analysis to analyze, represent, 
and model data. Simple computational simulations are created and 
used based on mathematical models of basic assumptions. 
  Use mathematical and/or computational representations of 

phenomena or design solutions to support explanations. (HS-
LS2-1) 

  Use mathematical representations of phenomena or design 
solutions to support and revise explanations. (HS-LS2-2)    
  Create or revise a simulation of a phenomenon, designed 

device, process, or system. (HS-LS4-6) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 9–12 builds on 
K–8 experiences and progresses to explanations and designs that 
are supported by multiple and independent student-generated 
sources of evidence consistent with scientific ideas, principles, and 
theories. 
  Design, evaluate, and refine a solution to a complex real-world 

problem, based on scientific knowledge, student-generated 
sources of evidence, prioritized criteria, and tradeoff 
considerations. (HS-LS2-7) 

Engaging in Argument from Evidence 
Engaging in argument from evidence in 9–12 builds from K–8 
experiences and progresses to using appropriate and sufficient 
evidence and scientific reasoning to defend and critique claims and 
explanations about the natural and designed world(s). Arguments 
may also come from current scientific or historical episodes in 
science. 
  Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning behind currently 
accepted explanations or solutions to determine the merits of 
arguments. (HS-LS2-6) 

  Evaluate the evidence behind currently accepted explanations 
or solutions to determine the merits of arguments. (HS-LS2-8) 

 

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Connections to Nature of Science  

 
Scientific Knowledge is Open to Revision in Light of New 
Evidence 
  Most scientific knowledge is quite durable, but is, in principle, 

subject to change based on new evidence and/or 
reinterpretation of existing evidence. (HS-LS2-2) 

  Scientific argumentation is a mode of logical discourse used to 

clarify the strength of relationships between ideas and 

Cause and Effect 
  Empirical evidence is required to 
differentiate between cause and 
correlation and make claims about specific 
causes and effects. (HS-LS2-8),(HS-LS4-6) 

Scale, Proportion, and Quantity 
  The significance of a phenomenon is 

dependent on the scale, proportion, and 
quantity at which it occurs. (HS-LS2-1) 

  Using the concept of orders of magnitude 
allows one to understand how a model at 
one scale relates to a model at another 
scale. (HS-LS2-2) 

Stability and Change 
  Much of science deals with constructing 
explanations of how things change and 
how they remain stable. (HS-LS2-6),(HS-
LS2-7) 

 

LS2.A:  Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems 
  Ecosystems have carrying capacities, which are limits to 

the numbers of organisms and populations they can 
support. These limits result from such factors as the 
availability of living and nonliving resources and from 
such challenges such as predation, competition, and 
disease. Organisms would have the capacity to produce 
populations of great size were it not for the fact that 
environments and resources are finite. This 
fundamental tension affects the abundance (number of 
individuals) of species in any given ecosystem. (HS-LS2-
1),(HS-LS2-2) 

LS2.C:  Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and 
Resilience 
  A complex set of interactions within an ecosystem can 

keep its numbers and types of organisms relatively 
constant over long periods of time under stable 
conditions. If a modest biological or physical 
disturbance to an ecosystem occurs, it may return to its 
more or less original status (i.e., the ecosystem is 
resilient), as opposed to becoming a very different 
ecosystem. Extreme fluctuations in conditions or the 
size of any population, however, can challenge the 
functioning of ecosystems in terms of resources and 
habitat availability.  (HS-LS2-2),(HS-LS2-6) 

  Moreover, anthropogenic changes (induced by human 

activity) in the environment—including habitat 
destruction, pollution, introduction of invasive species, 
overexploitation, and climate change—can disrupt an 
ecosystem and threaten the survival of some species. 
(HS-LS2-7) 

LS2.D:  Social Interactions and Group Behavior 
  Group behavior has evolved because membership can 

increase the chances of survival for individuals and their 
genetic relatives. (HS-LS2-8) 

LS4.C:  Adaptation 
  Changes in the physical environment, whether naturally 

occurring or human induced, have thus contributed to 
the expansion of some species, the emergence of new 
distinct species as populations diverge under different 
conditions, and the decline–and sometimes the 
extinction–of some species. (HS-LS4-6) 

LS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans  
  Biodiversity is increased by the formation of new 
species (speciation) and decreased by the loss of 
species (extinction). (secondary to HS-LS2-7) 

  Humans depend on the living world for the resources 

and other benefits provided by biodiversity. But human

activity is also having adverse impacts on biodiversity 
through overpopulation, overexploitation, habitat 
destruction, pollution, introduction of invasive species, 
and climate change. Thus sustaining biodiversity so that 
ecosystem functioning and productivity are maintained 
is essential to supporting and enhancing life on Earth. 
Sustaining biodiversity also aids humanity by preserving 
landscapes of recreational or inspirational value. 
(secondary to HS-LS2-7), (HS-LS4-6)  

ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions 
  When evaluating solutions, it is important to take into 
account a range of constraints, including cost, safety, 
reliability, and aesthetics, and to consider social, 
cultural, and environmental impacts. (secondary to HS-
LS2-7),(secondary to HS-LS4-6) 

  Both physical models and computers can be used in 

various ways to aid in the engineering design process. 
Computers are useful for a variety of purposes, such as 
running simulations to test different ways of solving a 
problem or to see which one is most efficient or 
economical; and in making a persuasive presentation to 
a client about how a given design will meet his or her 
needs. (secondary to HS-LS4-6)

The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education:

 Science and Engineering Practices 

Asking Questions and Defining Problems 		
Asking questions and defining problems in 9-12 builds on K-8 
experiences and progresses to formulating, refining, and evaluating 
empirically testable questions and design problems using models and 
simulations. 
  Ask questions that arise from examining models or a theory to 

clarify relationships. (HS-LS3-1) 

Developing and Using Models 
Modeling in 9–12 builds on K–8 experiences and progresses to using, 
synthesizing, and developing models to predict and show relationships 
among variables between systems and their components in the natural 
and designed worlds.   
  Use a model based on evidence to illustrate the relationships 

between systems or between components of a system. (HS-LS1-4) 

Analyzing and Interpreting Data 
Analyzing data in 9-12 builds on K-8 experiences and progresses to 
introducing more detailed statistical analysis, the comparison of data 
sets for consistency, and the use of models to generate and analyze 
data. 
  Apply concepts of statistics and probability (including determining 

function fits to data, slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient 
for linear fits) to scientific and engineering questions and 
problems, using digital tools when feasible.  (HS-LS3-3) 

Engaging in Argument from Evidence 
Engaging in argument from evidence in 9-12 builds on K-8 experiences 
and progresses to using appropriate and sufficient evidence and 
scientific reasoning to defend and critique claims and explanations 
about the natural and designed world(s).  Arguments may also come 
from current scientific or historical episodes in science. 
  Make and defend a claim based on evidence about the natural 
world that reflects scientific knowledge, and student-generated 
evidence. (HS-LS3-2) 

	

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

LS1.A:  Structure and Function 
  All cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA 
molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA that contain 
the instructions that code for the formation of 
proteins. (secondary to HS-LS3-1) (Note: This 
Disciplinary Core Idea is also addressed by HS-LS1-1.) 

LS1.B:  Growth and Development of Organisms 
  In multicellular organisms individual cells grow and 

then divide via a process called mitosis, thereby 
allowing the organism to grow.  The organism begins 
as a single cell (fertilized egg) that divides successively 
to produce many cells, with each parent cell passing 
identical genetic material (two variants of each 
chromosome pair) to both daughter cells. Cellular 
division and differentiation produce and maintain a 
complex organism, composed of systems of tissues 
and organs that work together to meet the needs of 
the whole organism. (HS-LS1-4) 

Cause and Effect 
  Empirical evidence is required to 
differentiate between cause and 
correlation and make claims about specific 
causes and effects. (HS-LS3-1),(HS-LS3-2) 

Scale, Proportion, and Quantity  
  Algebraic thinking is used to examine 

scientific data and predict the effect of a 
change in one variable on another (e.g., 
linear growth vs. exponential growth). (HS-
LS3-3) 

Systems and System Models 
  Models (e.g., physical, mathematical, 

computer models) can be used to simulate 
systems and interactions—including 
energy, matter, and information flows—
within and between systems at different 
scales. (HS-LS1-4) 

--------------------------------------------- 

Connections to Nature of Science  

 
Science is a Human Endeavor  
  Technological advances have influenced 
the progress of science and science has 
influenced advances in technology. (HS-
LS3-3) 

  Science and engineering are influenced by 
society and society is influenced by science 
and engineering. (HS-LS3-3) 

LS3.A:  Inheritance of Traits 
  Each chromosome consists of a single very long DNA 

 

molecule, and each gene on the chromosome is a 
particular segment of that DNA. The instructions for 
forming species’ characteristics are carried in DNA. All 
cells in an organism have the same genetic content, 
but the genes used (expressed) by the cell may be 
regulated in different ways.  Not all DNA codes for a 
protein; some segments of DNA are involved in 
regulatory or structural functions, and some have no 
as-yet known function. (HS-LS3-1) 

LS3.B:  Variation of Traits 
  In sexual reproduction, chromosomes can sometimes 

 

swap sections during the process of meiosis (cell 
division), thereby creating new genetic combinations 
and thus more genetic variation. Although DNA 
replication is tightly regulated and remarkably accurate, 
errors do occur and result in mutations, which are also 
a source of genetic variation. Environmental factors can 
also cause mutations in genes, and viable mutations 
are inherited. (HS-LS3-2) 

  Environmental factors also affect expression of traits, 

and hence affect the probability of occurrences of traits 
in a population. Thus the variation and distribution of 
traits observed depends on both genetic and 
environmental factors. (HS-LS3-2),(HS-LS3-3)

Students who demonstrate understanding can: 
HS-LS4-1.  Communicate scientific information that common ancestry and biological evolution are supported by multiple 
lines of empirical evidence.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on a conceptual understanding of the role each line of evidence has relating to 
common ancestry and biological evolution. Examples of evidence could include similarities in DNA sequences, anatomical structures, and order of appearance of 
structures in embryological development.]  

HS-LS4-2.  Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors:  (1) 
the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due 
to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of those 
organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on using 
evidence to explain the influence each of the four factors has on number of organisms, behaviors, morphology, or physiology in terms of ability to compete for limited 
resources and subsequent survival of individuals and adaptation of species. Examples of evidence could include mathematical models such as simple distribution 
graphs and proportional reasoning.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include other mechanisms of evolution, such as genetic drift, gene flow through 
migration, and co-evolution.]  

HS-LS4-3.  Apply concepts of statistics and probability to support explanations that organisms with an advantageous 

heritable trait tend to increase in proportion to organisms lacking this trait.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on analyzing 
shifts in numerical distribution of traits and using these shifts as evidence to support explanations.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment is limited to basic statistical 
and graphical analysis. Assessment does not include allele frequency calculations.] 

HS-LS4-4.  Construct an explanation based on evidence for how natural selection leads to adaptation of populations.  

[Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on using data to provide evidence for how specific biotic and abiotic differences in ecosystems (such as ranges of seasonal 
temperature, long-term climate change, acidity, light, geographic barriers, or evolution of other organisms) contribute to a change in gene frequency over time, 
leading to adaptation of populations.]    

HS-LS4-5.  Evaluate the evidence supporting claims that changes in environmental conditions may result in:  (1) increases in 
the number of individuals of some species, (2) the emergence of new species over time, and (3) the extinction of 
other species.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on determining cause and effect relationships for how changes to the environment such as deforestation, 
fishing, application of fertilizers, drought, flood, and the rate of change of the environment affect distribution or disappearance of traits in species.]

-------------------------------------------------------- 

Connections to Nature of Science  

 

Science Models, Laws, Mechanisms, and Theories Explain 
Natural Phenomena 
  A scientific theory is a substantiated explanation of some aspect of 

the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly
confirmed through observation and experiment and the science 
community validates each theory before it is accepted. If new 

sequences vary among species, but there are many overlaps; 
in fact, the ongoing branching that produces multiple lines of 
descent can be inferred by comparing the DNA sequences of 
different organisms. Such information is also derivable from the 
similarities and differences in amino acid sequences and from 
anatomical and embryological evidence. (HS-LS4-1) 

LS4.B:  Natural Selection 
  Natural selection occurs only if there is both (1) variation in the 
genetic information between organisms in a population and (2) 
variation in the expression of that genetic information—that is, 
trait variation—that leads to differences in performance among 
individuals. (HS-LS4-2),(HS-LS4-3) 

  The traits that positively affect survival are more likely to be

(HS-LS4-3) 

LS4.C:  Adaptation 
  Evolution is a consequence of the interaction of four factors: 
(1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the 
genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and 
sexual reproduction, (3) competition for an environment’s 
limited supply of the resources that individuals need in order to 
survive and reproduce, and (4) the ensuing proliferation of 
those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce 
in that environment. (HS-LS4-2) 

  Natural selection leads to adaptation, that is, to a population 

dominated by organisms that are anatomically, behaviorally, and 
physiologically well suited to survive and reproduce in a specific 
environment. That is, the differential survival and reproduction of 
organisms in a population that have an advantageous heritable 
trait leads to an increase in the proportion of individuals in future 
generations that have the trait and to a decrease in the 
proportion of individuals that do not. (HS-LS4-3),(HS-LS4-4) 

  Adaptation also means that the distribution of traits in a 

population can change when conditions change. (HS-LS4-3) 

  Changes in the physical environment, whether naturally 

occurring or human induced, have thus contributed to the 
expansion of some species, the emergence of new distinct 
species as populations diverge under different conditions, and 
the decline–and sometimes the extinction–of some species. 
(HS-LS4-5) 

  Species become extinct because they can no longer survive 

and reproduce in their altered environment. If members cannot 
adjust to change that is too fast or drastic, the opportunity for 
the species’ evolution is lost. (HS-LS4-5)

which a system is studied and can

differentiate between cause and 
correlation and make claims about 
specific causes and effects. (HS-

Students who demonstrate understanding can: 

HS.Space Systems 

HS-ESS1-1.  Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the life span of the sun and the role of nuclear fusion in the 

sun’s core to release energy that eventually reaches Earth in the form of radiation.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is 
on the energy transfer mechanisms that allow energy from nuclear fusion in the sun’s core to reach Earth. Examples of evidence for the model include 
observations of the masses and lifetimes of other stars, as well as the ways that the sun’s radiation varies due to sudden solar flares (“space weather”), the 11-
year sunspot cycle, and non-cyclic variations over centuries.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include details of the atomic and sub-atomic 
processes involved with the sun’s nuclear fusion.] 

HS-ESS1-2.  Construct an explanation of the Big Bang theory based on astronomical evidence of light spectra, motion of 
distant galaxies, and composition of matter in the universe.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the astronomical evidence of 
the red shift of light from galaxies as an indication that the universe is currently expanding, the cosmic microwave background as the remnant radiation from the 
Big Bang, and the observed composition of ordinary matter of the universe, primarily found in stars and interstellar gases (from the spectra of electromagnetic 
radiation from stars), which matches that predicted by the Big Bang theory (3/4 hydrogen and 1/4 helium).]   

HS-ESS1-3.  Communicate scientific ideas about the way stars, over their life cycle, produce elements.  [Clarification Statement:  
Emphasis is on the way nucleosynthesis, and therefore the different elements created, varies as a function of the mass of a star and the stage of its lifetime.] 
[Assessment Boundary:  Details of the many different nucleosynthesis pathways for stars of differing masses are not assessed.]    

HS-ESS1-4.  Use mathematical or computational representations to predict the motion of orbiting objects in the solar 

system.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on Newtonian gravitational laws governing orbital motions, which apply to human-made satellites as well as 
planets and moons.] [Assessment Boundary:  Mathematical representations for the gravitational attraction of bodies and Kepler’s Laws of orbital motions should 
not deal with more than two bodies, nor involve calculus.]   

The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education:

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

Developing and Using Models 
Modeling in 9–12 builds on K–8 experiences and progresses to 
using, synthesizing, and developing models to predict and show 
relationships among variables between systems and their 
components in the natural and designed world(s).      
  Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the relationships 

between systems or between components of a system. (HS-
ESS1-1) 

Using Mathematical and Computational Thinking 
Mathematical and computational thinking in 9–12 builds on K–8 
experiences and progresses to using algebraic thinking and analysis, 
a range of linear and nonlinear functions including trigonometric 
functions, exponentials and logarithms, and computational tools for 
statistical analysis to analyze, represent, and model data.  Simple 
computational simulations are created and used based on 
mathematical models of basic assumptions. 
  Use mathematical or computational representations of 

phenomena to describe explanations. (HS-ESS1-4) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions  
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 9–12 builds on 
K–8 experiences and progresses to explanations and designs that are 
supported by multiple and independent student-generated sources of 
evidence consistent with scientific ideas, principles, and theories. 
  Construct an explanation based on valid and reliable evidence 

obtained from a variety of sources (including students’ own 
investigations, models, theories, simulations, peer review) and 
the assumption that theories and laws that describe the natural 
world operate today as they did in the past and will continue to 
do so in the future. (HS-ESS1-2) 

Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information  
Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information in 9–12 builds 
on K–8 experiences and progresses to evaluating the validity and 
reliability of the claims, methods, and designs. 
  Communicate scientific ideas (e.g., about phenomena and/or the 

process of development and the design and performance of a 
proposed process or system) in multiple formats (including 
orally, graphically, textually, and mathematically). (HS-ESS1-3) 

 

----------------------------------------------- 

Connections to Nature of Science 

 

Science Models, Laws, Mechanisms, and Theories Explain 
Natural Phenomena 
  A scientific theory is a substantiated explanation of some aspect 

of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been 
repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment and 
the science community validates each theory before it is 
accepted. If new evidence is discovered that the theory does not 
accommodate, the theory is generally modified in light of this 
new evidence. (HS-ESS1-2) 

 ESS1.A:  The Universe and Its Stars 
  The star called the sun is changing and will burn out 
over a lifespan of approximately 10 billion years. (HS-
ESS1-1) 

  The study of stars’ light spectra and brightness is used 

to identify compositional elements of stars, their 
movements, and their distances from Earth. (HS-ESS1-
2),(HS-ESS1-3) 

  The Big Bang theory is supported by observations of 

distant galaxies receding from our own, of the 
measured composition of stars and non-stellar gases, 
and of the maps of spectra of the primordial radiation 
(cosmic microwave background) that still fills the 
universe. (HS-ESS1-2) 

  Other than the hydrogen and helium formed at the time 
of the Big Bang, nuclear fusion within stars produces all 
atomic nuclei lighter than and including iron, and the 
process releases electromagnetic energy. Heavier 
elements are produced when certain massive stars 
achieve a supernova stage and explode. (HS-ESS1-
2),(HS-ESS1-3) 

ESS1.B:  Earth and the Solar System 
  Kepler’s laws describe common features of the motions 

of orbiting objects, including their elliptical paths 
around the sun. Orbits may change due to the 
gravitational effects from, or collisions with, other 
objects in the solar system. (HS-ESS1-4) 

PS3.D:  Energy in Chemical Processes and Everyday 
Life 
  Nuclear Fusion processes in the center of the sun 

release the energy that ultimately reaches Earth as 
radiation. (secondary to HS-ESS1-1) 

PS4.B Electromagnetic Radiation 
  Atoms of each element emit and absorb characteristic 

frequencies of light. These characteristics allow 
identification of the presence of an element, even in 
microscopic quantities. (secondary to HS-ESS1-2) 

 

 

Scale, Proportion, and Quantity 
  The significance of a phenomenon is 

dependent on the scale, proportion, and 
quantity at which it occurs. (HS-ESS1-1) 

  Algebraic thinking is used to examine 

scientific data and predict the effect of a 
change in one variable on another (e.g., 
linear growth vs. exponential growth). 
(HS-ESS1-4) 

Energy and Matter 
  Energy cannot be created or destroyed–

only moved between one place and 
another place, between objects and/or 
fields, or between systems. (HS-ESS1-2) 

  In nuclear processes, atoms are not 
conserved, but the total number of 
protons plus neutrons is conserved. (HS-
ESS1-3) 

 

 

---------------------------------------------- 
Connection to Engineering, Technology,

and Applications of Science	

 
Interdependence of Science, 
Engineering, and Technology 
  Science and engineering complement each 

other in the cycle known as research and 
development (R&D). Many R&D projects 
may involve scientists, engineers, and 
others with wide ranges of expertise. (HS-
ESS1-2),(HS-ESS1-4) 

-------------------------------------------- 

Connection to Nature of Science 

 
Scientific Knowledge Assumes an Order 
and Consistency in Natural Systems 
  Scientific knowledge is based on the 
assumption that natural laws operate 
today as they did in the past and they will 
continue to do so in the future. (HS-ESS1-
2) 

  Science assumes the universe is a vast 

single system in which basic laws are 
consistent. (HS-ESS1-2)

HS-ESS1-5.  Evaluate evidence of the past and current movements of continental and oceanic crust and the theory of plate 
tectonics to explain the ages of crustal rocks.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the ability of plate tectonics to explain the ages of 
crustal rocks. Examples include evidence of the ages oceanic crust increasing with distance from mid-ocean ridges (a result of plate spreading) and the ages of 
North American continental crust increasing with distance away from a central ancient core (a result of past plate interactions).]   

HS-ESS1-6.  Apply scientific reasoning and evidence from ancient Earth materials, meteorites, and other planetary 

surfaces to construct an account of Earth’s formation and early history.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on using 
available evidence within the solar system to reconstruct the early history of Earth, which formed along with the rest of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. 
Examples of evidence include the absolute ages of ancient materials (obtained by radiometric dating of meteorites, moon rocks, and Earth’s oldest minerals), the 
sizes and compositions of solar system objects, and the impact cratering record of planetary surfaces.]  

HS-ESS2-1.  Develop a model to illustrate how Earth’s internal and surface processes operate at different spatial and 

temporal scales to form continental and ocean-floor features.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on how the appearance of land 
features (such as mountains, valleys, and plateaus) and sea-floor features (such as trenches, ridges, and seamounts) are a result of both constructive forces 
(such as volcanism, tectonic uplift, and orogeny) and destructive mechanisms (such as weathering, mass wasting, and coastal erosion).] [Assessment Boundary:  
Assessment does not include memorization of the details of the formation of specific geographic features of Earth’s surface.]

  Apply scientific reasoning to link evidence to the claims to 

assess the extent to which the reasoning and data support the 
explanation or conclusion. (HS-ESS1-6) 
Engaging in Argument from Evidence 
Engaging in argument from evidence in 9–12 builds on K–8 
experiences and progresses to using appropriate and sufficient 
evidence and scientific reasoning to defend and critique claims and 
explanations about the natural and designed world(s). Arguments 
may also come from current scientific or historical episodes in 
science. 
  Evaluate evidence behind currently accepted explanations or 
solutions to determine the merits of arguments. (HS-ESS1-5)

Crosscutting Concepts 

Patterns 
  Empirical evidence is needed to identify 

patterns. (HS-ESS1-5) 

Stability and Change 
  Much of science deals with constructing 
explanations of how things change and 
how they remain stable. (HS-ESS1-6) 

  Change and rates of change can be 

quantified and modeled over very short or 
very long periods of time. Some system 
changes are irreversible. (HS-ESS2-1) 
 
 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

ESS1.C:  The History of Planet Earth 
  Continental rocks, which can be older than 4 billion 

years, are generally much older than the rocks of the 
ocean floor, which are less than 200 million years old. 
(HS-ESS1-5) 

  Although active geologic processes, such as plate 

tectonics and erosion, have destroyed or altered most of 
the very early rock record on Earth, other objects in the 
solar system, such as lunar rocks, asteroids, and 
meteorites, have changed little over billions of years. 
Studying these objects can provide information about 
Earth’s formation and early history. (HS-ESS1-6) 

ESS2.A:  Earth Materials and Systems 
  Earth’s systems, being dynamic and interacting, cause 

feedback effects that can increase or decrease the 
original changes. (HS-ESS2-1) (Note: This Disciplinary 
Core Idea is also addressed by HS-ESS2-2.)  

ESS2.B:  Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System 
Interactions 
  Plate tectonics is the unifying theory that explains the 

past and current movements of the rocks at Earth’s 
surface and provides a framework for understanding its 
geologic history. (ESS2.B Grade 8 GBE) (secondary to 
HS-ESS1-5),(HS-ESS2-1) 

  Plate movements are responsible for most continental 

and ocean-floor features and for the distribution of most 
rocks and minerals within Earth’s crust. (ESS2.B Grade 8 
GBE) (HS-ESS2-1) 

PS1.C:  Nuclear Processes

HS.Earth’s Systems 
Students who demonstrate understanding can:  
HS-ESS2-2.  Analyze geoscience data to make the claim that one change to Earth’s surface can create feedbacks that 

cause changes to other Earth systems.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples should include climate feedbacks, such as how an increase in 
greenhouse gases causes a rise in global temperatures that melts glacial ice, which reduces the amount of sunlight reflected from Earth’s surface, increasing 
surface temperatures and further reducing the amount of ice. Examples could also be taken from other system interactions, such as how the loss of ground 
vegetation causes an increase in water runoff and soil erosion; how dammed rivers increase groundwater recharge, decrease sediment transport, and increase 

coastal erosion; or how the loss of wetlands causes a decrease in local humidity that further reduces the wetland extent.] 	 

HS-ESS2-3.  Develop a model based on evidence of Earth’s interior to describe the cycling of matter by thermal convection. 
[Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on both a one-dimensional model of Earth, with radial layers determined by density, and a three-dimensional model, which 
is controlled by mantle convection and the resulting plate tectonics. Examples of evidence include maps of Earth’s three-dimensional structure obtained from 
seismic waves, records of the rate of change of Earth’s magnetic field (as constraints on convection in the outer core), and identification of the composition of 
Earth’s layers from high-pressure laboratory experiments.] 

HS-ESS2-5.  Plan and conduct an investigation of the properties of water and its effects on Earth materials and surface 
processes.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on mechanical and chemical investigations with water and a variety of solid materials to provide the 
evidence for connections between the hydrologic cycle and system interactions commonly known as the rock cycle. Examples of mechanical investigations 
include stream transportation and deposition using a stream table, erosion using variations in soil moisture content, or frost wedging by the expansion of water 
as it freezes. Examples of chemical investigations include chemical weathering and recrystallization (by testing the solubility of different materials) or melt 
generation (by examining how water lowers the melting temperature of most solids).]  

HS-ESS2-6.  Develop a quantitative model to describe the cycling of carbon among the hydrosphere, atmosphere, 

geosphere, and biosphere.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on modeling biogeochemical cycles that include the cycling of carbon through the 
ocean, atmosphere, soil, and biosphere (including humans), providing the foundation for living organisms.] 
HS-ESS2-7.  Construct an argument based on evidence about the simultaneous coevolution of Earth’s systems and life on 

Earth.  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the dynamic causes, effects, and feedbacks between the biosphere and Earth’s other systems, whereby 
geoscience factors control the evolution of life, which in turn continuously alters Earth’s surface. Examples of include how photosynthetic life altered the 
atmosphere through the production of oxygen, which in turn increased weathering rates and allowed for the evolution of animal life; how microbial life on land 
increased the formation of soil, which in turn allowed for the evolution of land plants; or how the evolution of corals created reefs that altered patterns of 
erosion and deposition along coastlines and provided habitats for the evolution of new life forms.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include a 
comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of how the biosphere interacts with all of Earth’s other systems.]

Crosscutting Concepts 

Developing and Using Models 
Modeling in 9–12 builds on K–8 experiences and progresses to 
using, synthesizing, and developing models to predict and 
show relationships among variables between systems and 
their components in the natural and designed world(s).      
  Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the 

relationships between systems or between components of 
a system. (HS-ESS2-3),(HS-ESS2-6) 

Planning and Carrying Out Investigations 
Planning and carrying out investigations in 9-12 builds on K-8 
experiences and progresses to include investigations that 
provide evidence for and test conceptual, mathematical, 
physical, and empirical models. 
  Plan and conduct an investigation individually and 

collaboratively to produce data to serve as the basis for 
evidence, and in the design: decide on types, how much, 
and accuracy of data needed to produce reliable 
measurements and consider limitations on the precision of 
the data (e.g., number of trials, cost, risk, time), and refine 
the design accordingly. (HS-ESS2-5) 

Analyzing and Interpreting Data 
Analyzing data in 9–12 builds on K–8 experiences and 
progresses to introducing more detailed statistical analysis, the 
comparison of data sets for consistency, and the use of models 
to generate and analyze data. 
  Analyze data using tools, technologies, and/or models 

(e.g., computational, mathematical) in order to make valid 
and reliable scientific claims or determine an optimal 
design solution. (HS-ESS2-2) 

Engaging in Argument from Evidence 
Engaging in argument from evidence in 9–12 builds on K–8 
experiences and progresses to using appropriate and sufficient 
evidence and scientific reasoning to defend and critique claims 
and explanations about the natural and designed world(s). 
Arguments may also come from current scientific or historical 
episodes in science. 
  Construct an oral and written argument or counter-

arguments based on data and evidence. (HS-ESS2-7)

Connections to Nature of Science 

 
Scientific Knowledge is Based on Empirical Evidence 

ESS2.A:  Earth Materials and Systems 
  Earth’s systems, being dynamic and interacting, cause feedback 

effects that can increase or decrease the original changes (HS-
ESS2-2) 

  Evidence from deep probes and seismic waves, reconstructions 

of historical changes in Earth’s surface and its magnetic field, 
and an understanding of physical and chemical processes lead to 
a model of Earth with a hot but solid inner core, a liquid outer 
core, a solid mantle and crust. Motions of the mantle and its 
plates occur primarily through thermal convection, which 
involves the cycling of matter due to the outward flow of energy 
from Earth’s interior and gravitational movement of denser 
materials toward the interior. (HS-ESS2-3) 

ESS2.B:  Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System 
Interactions 
  The radioactive decay of unstable isotopes continually generates 

new energy within Earth’s crust and mantle, providing the 
primary source of the heat that drives mantle convection. Plate 
tectonics can be viewed as the surface expression of mantle 
convection. (HS-ESS2-3) 

ESS2.C:  The Roles of Water in Earth’s Surface Processes 
  The abundance of liquid water on Earth’s surface and its unique 

combination of physical and chemical properties are central to 
the planet’s dynamics. These properties include water’s 
exceptional capacity to absorb, store, and release large amounts 
of energy, transmit sunlight, expand upon freezing, dissolve and 
transport materials, and lower the viscosities and melting points 
of rocks. (HS-ESS2-5) 

ESS2.D:  Weather and Climate 
  The foundation for Earth’s global climate systems is the 

electromagnetic radiation from the sun, as well as its reflection, 
absorption, storage, and redistribution among the atmosphere, 
ocean, and land systems, and this energy’s re-radiation into 
space. (HS-ESS2-2) 

  Gradual atmospheric changes were due to plants and other 

organisms that captured carbon dioxide and released oxygen. 
(HS-ESS2-6),(HS-ESS2-7) 

  Changes in the atmosphere due to human activity have 

increased carbon dioxide concentrations and thus affect climate. 
(HS-ESS2-6) 

ESS2.E:  Biogeology 
  The many dynamic and delicate feedbacks between the 
biosphere and other Earth systems cause a continual co-

Energy and Matter 
  The total amount of energy and matter 

in closed systems is conserved. (HS-
ESS2-6) 

  Energy drives the cycling of matter 

within and between systems. (HS-ESS2-
3) 

Structure and Function 
  The functions and properties of natural 
and designed objects and systems can 
be inferred from their overall structure, 
the way their components are shaped 
and used, and the molecular 
substructures of its various materials. 
(HS-ESS2-5) 

Stability and Change  
  Much of science deals with constructing 
explanations of how things change and 
how they remain stable. (HS-ESS2-7) 
  Feedback (negative or positive) can 
stabilize or destabilize a system. (HS-
ESS2-2)

Interdependence of Science, 
Engineering, and Technology 
  Science and engineering complement 

each other in the cycle known as 
research and development (R&D). Many 
R&D projects may involve scientists, 
engineers, and others with wide ranges 
of expertise. (HS-ESS2-3) 

Influence of Engineering, Technology, 
and Science on Society and the Natural 
World 
  New technologies can have deep 

impacts on society and the 
environment, including some that were 
not anticipated. Analysis of costs and 
benefits is a critical aspect of decisions

ocean circulation; 10-100s of years: changes in human activity, ocean circulation, solar output; 10-100s of thousands of years: changes to Earth's orbit and 
the orientation of its axis; and 10-100s of millions of years: long-term changes in atmospheric composition.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment of the

Scientific Investigations Use a Variety of Methods 
  Science investigations use diverse methods and do not always 

use the same set of procedures to obtain data. (HS-ESS3-5) 
  New technologies advance scientific knowledge. (HS-ESS3-5) 
Scientific Knowledge is Based on Empirical Evidence 
  Science knowledge is based on empirical evidence. (HS-ESS3-5)  
  Science arguments are strengthened by multiple lines of 

evidence supporting a single explanation. (HS-ESS2-4), (HS-
ESS3-5) 

ESS1.B:  Earth and the Solar System 
  Cyclical changes in the shape of Earth’s orbit around the sun, 

together with changes in the tilt of the planet’s axis of rotation, 
both occurring over hundreds of thousands of years, have altered 
the intensity and distribution of sunlight falling on the earth. These 
phenomena cause a cycle of ice ages and other gradual climate 
changes. (secondary to HS-ESS2-4) 

ESS2.A:  Earth Materials and Systems 
  The geological record shows that changes to global and regional 

climate can be caused by interactions among changes in the sun’s 
energy output or Earth’s orbit, tectonic events, ocean circulation, 
volcanic activity, glaciers, vegetation, and human activities. These 
changes can occur on a variety of time scales from sudden (e.g., 
volcanic ash clouds) to intermediate (ice ages) to very long-term 
tectonic cycles. (HS-ESS2-4) 
ESS2.D:  Weather and Climate 
  The foundation for Earth’s global climate systems is the

absorption, storage, and redistribution among the atmosphere, 
ocean, and land systems, and this energy’s re-radiation into space. 
(HS-ESS2-4),(secondary to HS-ESS2-2) 

  Changes in the atmosphere due to human activity have increased 

carbon dioxide concentrations and thus affect climate. (HS-ESS2-4)

  Though the magnitudes of human impacts are greater than they 
have ever been, so too are human abilities to model, predict, and 
manage current and future impacts. (HS-ESS3-5)

  Empirical evidence is required to 
differentiate between cause and 
correlation and make claims 
about specific causes and 
effects. (HS-ESS2-4)

HS.Human Sustainability 

HS-ESS3-1.  Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of 

natural hazards, and changes in climate have influenced human activity.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of key natural 
resources include access to fresh water (such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater), regions of fertile soils such as river deltas, and high concentrations of minerals 
and fossil fuels. Examples of natural hazards can be from interior processes (such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes), surface processes (such as tsunamis, 
mass wasting and soil erosion), and severe weather (such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts). Examples of the results of changes in climate that can affect 
populations or drive mass migrations include changes to sea level, regional patterns of temperature and precipitation, and the types of crops and livestock that 
can be raised.] 

HS-ESS3-2.  Evaluate competing design solutions for developing, managing, and utilizing energy and mineral resources 

based on cost-benefit ratios.*  [Clarification Statement:  Emphasis is on the conservation, recycling, and reuse of resources (such as minerals and 
metals) where possible, and on minimizing impacts where it is not. Examples include developing best practices for agricultural soil use, mining (for coal, tar 
sands, and oil shales), and pumping (for petroleum and natural gas). Science knowledge indicates what can happen in natural systems—not what should 
happen.]    

HS-ESS3-3.  Create a computational simulation to illustrate the relationships among management of natural resources, 

the sustainability of human populations, and biodiversity.  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of factors that affect the management 
of natural resources include costs of resource extraction and waste management, per-capita consumption, and the development of new technologies. Examples 
of factors that affect human sustainability include agricultural efficiency, levels of conservation, and urban planning.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment for 
computational simulations is limited to using provided multi-parameter programs or constructing simplified spreadsheet calculations.] 

HS-ESS3-4.  Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.*  

[Clarification Statement:  Examples of data on the impacts of human activities could include the quantities and types of pollutants released, changes to biomass 
and species diversity, or areal changes in land surface use (such as for urban development, agriculture and livestock, or surface mining). Examples for limiting 
future impacts could range from local efforts (such as reducing, reusing, and recycling resources) to large-scale geoengineering design solutions (such as 
altering global temperatures by making large changes to the atmosphere or ocean).] 

HS-ESS3-6.  Use a computational representation to illustrate the relationships among Earth systems and how those 

relationships are being modified due to human activity.*  [Clarification Statement:  Examples of Earth systems to be considered are 
the hydrosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, and/or biosphere. An example of the far-reaching impacts from a human activity is how an increase in 
atmospheric carbon dioxide results in an increase in photosynthetic biomass on land and an increase in ocean acidification, with resulting impacts on sea 
organism health and marine populations.] [Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include running computational representations but is limited to using 
the published results of scientific computational models.]

K-8 experiences and progresses to using algebraic thinking 
and analysis, a range of linear and nonlinear functions 
including trigonometric functions, exponentials and

simulations are created and used based on mathematical 
models of basic assumptions. 
  Create a computational model or simulation of a 

phenomenon, designed device, process, or system. (HS-

  Use a computational representation of phenomena or 

design solutions to describe and/or support claims 
and/or explanations. (HS-ESS3-6) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions 
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 9–12 
builds on K–8  experiences and progresses to explanations 
and designs that are supported by multiple and independent 
student-generated sources of evidence consistent with 
scientific knowledge, principles, and theories. 
  Construct an explanation based on valid and reliable 

evidence obtained from a variety of sources (including 
students’ own investigations, models, theories, 
simulations, peer review) and the assumption that 
theories and laws that describe the natural world 
operate today as they did in the past and will continue 
to do so in the future. (HS-ESS3-1)

or historical episodes in science. 
  Evaluate competing design solutions to a real-world 

problem based on scientific ideas and principles, 
empirical evidence, and logical arguments regarding 

ESS2.D:  Weather and Climate 
  Current models predict that, although future regional climate 

changes will be complex and varied, average global 
temperatures will continue to rise. The outcomes predicted by 
global climate models strongly depend on the amounts of 
human-generated greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere 
each year and by the ways in which these gases are absorbed 
by the ocean and biosphere. (secondary to HS-ESS3-6) 

ESS3.A:  Natural Resources 
  Resource availability has guided the development of human 

society. (HS-ESS3-1) 

  All forms of energy production and other resource extraction 

have associated economic, social, environmental, and 
geopolitical costs and risks as well as benefits. New technologies 
and social regulations can change the balance of these factors. 
(HS-ESS3-2) 

ESS3.B:  Natural Hazards 
  Natural hazards and other geologic events have shaped the 

course of human history; [they] have significantly altered the 
sizes of human populations and have driven human migrations. 
(HS-ESS3-1) 

ESS3.C:  Human Impacts on Earth Systems 
  The sustainability of human societies and the biodiversity that 

supports them requires responsible management of natural 
resources. (HS-ESS3-3) 

  Scientists and engineers can make major contributions by 

developing technologies that produce less pollution and waste 
and that preclude ecosystem degradation. (HS-ESS3-4) 

ESS3.D:  Global Climate Change

discoveries are still being made about how the ocean, the 
atmosphere, and the biosphere interact and are modified in 
response to human activities. (HS-ESS3-6)  

ETS1.B. Developing Possible Solutions 
  When evaluating solutions, it is important to take into account a 

range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and 
aesthetics, and to consider social, cultural, and environmental 
impacts. (secondary to HS-ESS3-2),(secondary to HS-ESS3-4) 

Cause and Effect 
  Empirical evidence is required to 
differentiate between cause and 
correlation and make claims about specific 
causes and effects. (HS-ESS3-1) 

Systems and System Models 
  When investigating or describing a system, 
the boundaries and initial conditions of the 
system need to be defined and their inputs 
and outputs analyzed and described using 
models. (HS-ESS3-6)

Science is a Human Endeavor 
  Scientific knowledge is a result of human 

endeavors, imagination, and creativity. 
(HS-ESS3-3) 

 
Science Addresses Questions About the 
Natural and Material World 
  Science and technology may raise ethical 

issues for which science, by itself, does not 
provide answers and solutions. (HS-ESS3-

  Science knowledge indicates what can 
happen in natural systems—not what 
should happen. The latter involves ethics, 
values, and human decisions about the use 
of knowledge. (HS-ESS3-2) 

  Many decisions are not made using science 

alone, but rely on social and cultural 
contexts to resolve issues. (HS-ESS3-2)

HS.Engineering Design 
Students who demonstrate understanding can: 
HS-ETS1-1.  Analyze a major global challenge to specify qualitative and quantitative criteria and constraints for solutions 

HS-ETS1-2.  Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable 

that account for societal needs and wants.   
 

problems that can be solved through engineering. 

 

 

HS-ETS1-3.  Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account 
for a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, as well as possible social, cultural, 
and environmental impacts.   

HS-ETS1-4.  Use a computer simulation to model the impact of proposed solutions to a complex real-world problem with 

numerous criteria and constraints on interactions within and between systems relevant to the problem.  

The performance expectations above were developed using the following elements from the NRC document A Framework for K-12 Science Education:

Science and Engineering Practices 

 

Disciplinary Core Ideas 

Crosscutting Concepts 

ETS1.A:  Defining and Delimiting Engineering Problems 
  Criteria and constraints also include satisfying any requirements 

Systems and System Models 
  Models (e.g., physical, mathematical, 

Asking Questions and Defining Problems 
Asking questions and defining problems in 9–12 builds on K–8 
experiences and progresses to formulating, refining, and 
evaluating empirically testable questions and design problems 
using models and simulations.  
  Analyze complex real-world problems by specifying criteria 

and constraints for successful solutions. (HS-ETS1-1) 

Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking 
Mathematical and computational thinking in 9-12 builds on K-8 
experiences and progresses to using algebraic thinking and 
analysis, a range of linear and nonlinear functions including 
trigonometric functions, exponentials and logarithms, and 
computational tools for statistical analysis to analyze, 
represent, and model data. Simple computational simulations 
are created and used based on mathematical models of basic 
assumptions. 
  Use mathematical models and/or computer simulations to 
predict the effects of a design solution on systems and/or 
the interactions between systems. (HS-ETS1-4) 

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions  
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 9–12 
builds on K–8 experiences and progresses to explanations and 
designs that are supported by multiple and independent 
student-generated sources of evidence consistent with 
scientific ideas, principles and theories.  
  Design a solution to a complex real-world problem, based 

on scientific knowledge, student-generated sources of 
evidence, prioritized criteria, and tradeoff considerations. 
(HS-ETS1-2) 

  Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem, 

based on scientific knowledge, student-generated sources 
of evidence, prioritized criteria, and tradeoff 
considerations. (HS-ETS1-3) 

set by society, such as taking issues of risk mitigation into 
account, and they should be quantified to the extent possible 
and stated in such a way that one can tell if a given design 
meets them. (HS-ETS1-1) 

  Humanity faces major global challenges today, such as the need 

for supplies of clean water and food or for energy sources that 
minimize pollution, which can be addressed through engineering. 
These global challenges also may have manifestations in local 
communities. (HS-ETS1-1) 

ETS1.B:  Developing Possible Solutions 
  When evaluating solutions, it is important to take into account a 

range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and 
aesthetics, and to consider social, cultural, and environmental 
impacts. (HS-ETS1-3) 

  Both physical models and computers can be used in various 

ways to aid in the engineering design process. Computers are 
useful for a variety of purposes, such as running simulations to 
test different ways of solving a problem or to see which one is 
most efficient or economical; and in making a persuasive 
presentation to a client about how a given design will meet his 
or her needs. (HS-ETS1-4) 

ETS1.C:  Optimizing the Design Solution 
  Criteria may need to be broken down into simpler ones that can 
be approached systematically, and decisions about the priority of 
certain criteria over others (trade-offs) may be needed. (HS-
ETS1-2)

simulate systems and interactions—
including energy, matter, and 
information flows— within and between 
systems at different scales. (HS-ETS1-4)
