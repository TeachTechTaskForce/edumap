Each group of children will need:
a copy of the blackline master on pages 209 and 210, and
a copy of the images on page 211, either on overhead projector transparency or on cards
that can be displayed to the class, and
one or more of the six cards contained in the blackline master on page 212. Cut the sheet
into individual cards and divide them between the groups.
