The children are divided into groups of about four, and within these groups they form two
subgroups. Each subgroup is given a copy of the two maps on page 193. Thus for each group
of children you will need:
two copies of the blackline master on page 193.
You will also need:
an overhead projector transparency of page 194, and
a way to annotate the diagram.
